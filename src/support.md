# Support

## Advice and queries: TEI-L mailing list
The TEI boasts a friendly and highly skilled worldwide user community, whose members are quite willing to share their expertise. The best way
to tap into this community is to join the TEI-L discussion list. Everyone is welcome to subscribe to the list, either via a [webform](https://lists.psu.edu/cgi-bin/wa?SUBED1=TEI-L&A=1) or by sending an email to [TEI-L-subscribe-request@lists.psu.edu](mailto:TEI-L-subscribe-request@lists.psu.edu).
Archived messages from the list can be browsed or searched online [through the LISTSERV archive](https://lists.psu.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A0=TEI-L)
and cover just about every text encoding topic you can imagine. All queries or comments about the TEI Guidelines or text encoding issues in general
should be sent to the TEI-L list. You can unsubscribe from the list by sending an email to <mailto:TEI-L-unsubscribe-request@lists.psu.edu>
There is also [a list for the francophone community](https://groupes.renater.fr/wiki/tei-fr/).

For queries or comments about non-technical matters, please see the list of addresses on our [contacts page](../About/contact.xml).

## Slack
In addition to the TEI-L mailing list, the TEI uses an instance of Slack for some asynchronous communication. As with other communication mediums, this is open to the entire TEI Community, regardless of whether they are paying members or not. However, you need to be invited to the TEI-C Slack and the process to do so is [to fill out this google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSea-bODBGKqVAHvU7bwNMcVLRRy6XjQNkrPlBbab6XIIocjSQ/viewform?usp=header). The form will be reviewed and approved by an admin as soon as possible.   

## Social Media
The TEI maintains a presence on various social media. These may be used to advertise events, etc., but the mailing list and slack platform remain the better sources of discussion and advice.

## Feature requests and bug reports

On the [TEI's GitHub Site](https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues) the TEI keeps track of
[Bug Reports](https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Type%3A+Bug%22) and
[Feature Requests](https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Type%3A+FeatureRequest%22).
As long as you are logged into your GitHub account you may
report a bug or add a feature request, or comment on existing tickets. There are a number of repositories for the [TEI Organization on GitHub](https://github.com/TEIC/). 

## Funding bid development
The TEI also can assist projects in the development of funding bid proposals that include TEI membership. We may be able to review the technical portion of the proposal to help ensure that it is plausible and realistic, and that it describes the use of TEI in a persuasive manner. We can also help projects think through the strategic and practical issues involved in designing a TEI project, so that costs and staffing can be accurately assessed and planned. Get in touch early in order to allow sufficient time for review and feedback, usually we would need at least six weeks before your internal submission deadline. For more information about this please read our page on [support for funding bids](bids), and if appropriate contact the TEI at chair@tei-c.org.

## Learn the TEI
Interested in learning how to use the TEI Guidelines themselves? The [Learn the TEI](Learn/)
page provides a selection of introductory readings and general
how-to guides, as well as guides to local practice submitted by other TEI users. For
information about classes and workshops that offer formal instruction in use of
the TEI Guidelines, see the [events calendar](http://members.tei-c.org/Events).
