# About
The Text Encoding Initiative Consortium is an international organization whose mission is to
develop and maintain guidelines for the digital encoding of literary and linguistic texts. The
Consortium publishes the Text Encoding Initiative Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and
Interchange: an international and interdisciplinary standard that is widely used by libraries,
museums, publishers, and individual scholars to represent all kinds of textual material for
online research and teaching.

The TEI is supported by annual dues from institutional members and individual subscribers,
with additional funding from grants and the institutional support of its hosts. Its chief
activities include the publication and ongoing development of the TEI Guidelines, and support
for their use with schema development tools, training and documentation initiatives, discussion
forums, and an annual conference.

The TEI community is broad-based and international in scope, including members in North
America, Europe, Australia, and Asia and users at hundreds of universities, libraries, research
units, and businesses worldwide. The materials encoded with the TEI Guidelines are as various as
its practitioners, spanning the breadth of the humanities and social sciences and occasional
usage in the scientific community as well. In addition to wide adoption in digital libraries,
the TEI is used to represent manuscripts, research papers, historical archives, early printed
books, linguistic corpora, anthologies, critical editions, ancient inscriptions, and a wealth of
other literary, historical, and cultural material. The scope of the TEI is constantly expanding
and the Guidelines are in steady ongoing development to keep pace with the emerging needs of the
TEI community.
