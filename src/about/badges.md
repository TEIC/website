Let others know you use the TEI
-------------------------------


 (See also the [TEI Logos page](/About/Logos/))
 
 The [Guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative](/Guidelines/) are now in their fifth version. With more than 20 years of work behind
 them, they are a de facto standard in many areas of textual markup. The Guidelines are used by [hundreds of projects](/Activities/Projects/) around the world. Their use is required by many public funding agencies.
 
 Many projects use the TEI Guidelines 'behind the scenes' while delivering their content to the public using HTML. The
 following buttons provide an easy way of letting others know that an individual, group,
 or project makes use of the Guidelines in its work. Publicising your use of the TEI is an important part of ensuring the
 continuing viability of the TEI community and the TEI's profile within your discipline.
 The code snippets associated with each button direct users to the TEI website, encouraging
 your visitors and colleagues to investigate the use of the TEI for their own digital
 work.
 
 In contrast to buttons published by organisations like the W3C World Wide Web Consortium, these TEI buttons do not make any specific claims about
 how the TEI is being used by a project. The TEI is used in so many different ways
 by so many different organisations that it would be next-to-impossible to establish
 a series of buttons associated with a specific validation programme or to describe
 specific types of usage. For us, it is enough that you use the TEI in your project.
 
 Thank you very much for helping us publicise your participation in the TEI community!
 
 The badges
----------


 There are three sets of badges available. They read:
 *  `I use <TEI>` 
 * `We use <TEI>`
 *  `Powered by <TEI>`. 
 
 How you use these is up to you.
 
 Each set is rendered in two formats: [PNG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG) and [GIF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF). The PNG versions are preferable if you donâ€™t need to accommodate older Web browser
 versions, as the their transparency effects are superior. They will not display properly
 in Microsoft Internet Explorer prior to version 7, however. The GIF versions are provided
 for compatibility with such browser versions.
 
 For the PNG version of the badges, we have supplied code that allows you to insert
 the image, with a link to our site, in either HTML or TEI XML. For the GIF format
 badges, we have provided code for use with HTML. The images use the main TEI website
 for their URL: [http://www.tei-c.org/About/Badges/](/About/Badges/). You may download these images to your local server if you wish. Using the TEI URL
 allows us to track dissemination throughout the community, however.
