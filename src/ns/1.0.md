# TEI Namespace

The TEI namespace URI, `http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0`, redirects here. The namespace of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) was agreed by the TEI Technical Council in 2002.

This namespace should be regarded as permanent. There are no plans for it to change.

XML namespaces are used only as unique names and are not dereferenced during processing.
