# Learn the TEI



[Introducing the TEI Guidelines](/support/learn/introducing-the-guidelines/)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------



 
 This introduction provides an overview of the TEI Guidelines, describing their purpose
 and overall design, and addressing basic concepts of validity and TEI conformance.

 
[Teach Yourself TEI](/support/learn/teach-yourself-tei/)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------



 
 Although the TEI itself does not currently maintain any tutorials for learning TEI,
 the TEI community has produced a wide range of materials including online tutorials,
 materials used in teaching TEI workshops (some of which are held on a regular basis),
 and project documentation. The TEI maintains a listing of these materials and welcomes
 additions.
 
 
[A Gentle Introduction to XML](/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/SG.html)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------



 
 The *Gentle Introduction* is one of the most often cited sections of the TEI Guidelines and has proven its
 usefulness as an introduction to the essentials of XML markup. It defines and describes
 elements, attributes, entities, validity, well-formedness, schemas and DTDs. While
 it is necessarily somewhat technical in nature, it is written for a non-specialist
 audience and provides an essential background for understanding how encoding languages
 like the TEI work.
 
 
[Orientation to TEI P5 ODDs](/guidelines/customization/)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 
 The underlying expression of the TEI Guidelines is a document called an ODD (or One Document Does it all), so called because it constitutes a single source from which the P5 schemas, reference
 documentation, and Guidelines prose are derived. The ODD language (which is part of
 the TEI language itself) is also the language in which TEI customizations are written.
 This page lists resources to learn and work with the ODD language in order to produce TEI customizations, either working with 
 the web-based [Roma](https://roma.tei-c.org) tool, or by writing TEI ODD code directly.
 
 
[Bibliography](/support/learn/a-bibliography-of-publications-related-to-the-text-encoding-initiative/)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 
 This bibliography of publications relating to the TEI provides further reading on
 the background, context, theory, and practice of TEI encoding.
