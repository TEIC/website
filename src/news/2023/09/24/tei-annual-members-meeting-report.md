Reports
-------


### Board of Directors


(Diane Jakacki):
#### 2022-23 Activity


* Considered/proposed new elections model
* Reviewed listserv migration options with Council
* Began process of reviewing and updating Bylaws
* Worked with Council on plans for website migration
* Shepherded designs and launch of new [TEI logo](https://tei-c.org/about/logos/)


#### 2023-24 Goals


* Propose new membership model - toward vote by membership
* Prepare for membership drive
* Propose general Bylaws update
* Support and participate in development of new website
* Develop opportunities for inclusion in TEI events and governance


### Technical Council


(Elisa Beshero-Bondar):
* Completed and closed 115 tickets and pull requests
* Issued two releases:
	+ [Version 4.5.0](/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/readme-4.5.0.html), "the Release of One's Own", October 26, 2022: (added a new <gender> element and revised <sex>, <person>, and <persona>, allowed for nested <ab> elements)
	+ [Version 4.6.0](https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/readme-4.6.0.html), "the Peace Release" of the TEI Guidelines, April 4, 2023  (<lg> may now include model.pPart.transcriptional, including supplied, redo, and damage )
* Met face-to-face twice, during the LINCS conference in Guelph, Ontario in May 2023 and in Paderborn in September 2023
	+ Hatched plans for a new "TEI Lite 2" customization
	+ Worked on i8n and improving accessibility of the Guidelines "spec" pages
	+ Contributed to planning of a more robust TEI-C website
* TEI Stylesheets Co-op group
* Another TEI Odd Processor (ATOP) task force: Weekly meetings on upgrading the processing of customization ODDs


### Treasurer's Report


(Hugh Cayless)
* With return to post-Pandemic style activities, spending has increased to pre-2019 levels, with expenses focused mainly on meeting/travel and financial/management services
* Income is down from pre-2019 levels, and that trend looks to continue into the future based on declining number of institutional members vs. individual members
* TEI-C is in a strong cash position, with 14.4 months of reserves (current estimate). We're not in financial trouble, but need to evaluate future income vs. expenses


### Membership


(Cayless):
Breakdown:
Membership type: Number


* Sustaining Partner ($5,000) = 2
* Patron ($2,500) = 3
* Friend ($1,500) = 5
* Contributor ($500) = 15
* Supporter ($250) = 25
* Individual ($50) = 281


The trend in academic institutions toward continued austerity suggests that the Sustaining Partner and Patron institutional membership levels will not provide increased membership income in the near future.
### Infrastucture


(Beshero-Bondar, Cayless)
* **Mailing Lists:** With staff at Brown moving to other institutions or now retired, the TEI listservs hosted there (18 separate accounts) are vulnerable to lack of support and cancellation.
	+ Board and Council discussed and pursued multiple options, including changing to a different mailing list platform, considering whether it is sustainable to continue to align with institutions based on employees active in TEI, and/or professional hosting services.
	+ Beshero-Bondar approached Penn State about long-term hosting of listservs (all 18 accounts, plus complete archive including searchable access)
	+ Penn State and Brown are testing transfer, with preliminary tests successful, and a goal of end of 2023 for complete transfer pending successful transfer of searchable archives.
* **Website**: Cayless has for a long time advocated for moving the website from the current Wordpress instance to a more efficient, sustainable, streamlined, flattened structure.
	+ Cayless presented a prototype of a site in 11ty, which can be maintained in the current GitHub repositories in Markdown files.
	+ Cayless estimated that transition to the new site would take approximately a year.
