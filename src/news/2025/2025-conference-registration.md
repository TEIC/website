Dear colleagues — please join us for the annual Text Encoding Initiative conference in Kraków, Poland, 16-20 September!

The theme of this year’s TEI conference is “New Territories” and celebrates the twenty-fifth anniversary of the conference. In addition to a rich program of presentations, workshops, a banquet, and exciting outings (which can be viewed [here](https://tei-c.org/news/2025/TEINewTerritoriesProgramme1.1.1.pdf)), we are thrilled to have three great speakers joining us: Jadwiga Kita-Huber (Jagiellonian University), Sebastian Winkler (European Research Council), and Julia Flanders (Northeastern University). 

Registration is open through 15 August. The registration form can be accessed [here](https://www.konferencje-uj.pl/?lang=en&go2rej=1&kid=392). 

We look forward to seeing you in Kraków!!
