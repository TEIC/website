## Call for Hosts for TEI 2027
The Consortium of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI-C) is seeking potential hosts for the TEI 2027 Conference. The TEI-C is a vibrant international community which develops and maintains a standard for the representation of texts in digital form. As you know, its chief deliverable is a set of Guidelines which specify encoding methods for machine-readable texts, chiefly in the humanities, social sciences and linguistics. In addition to the Guidelines themselves, the Consortium provides a variety of resources for learning TEI, information on projects using the TEI, software developed for or adapted to the TEI, and runs an international conference with an annual general meeting.

The annual TEI Consortium Conference is usually held sometime in the months of August to November and brings together members of and contributors to the TEI community to share research, teach workshops, showcase tools and techniques as well as provide a report of the state of the TEI-C as part of the Annual General Meeting.

**We are now seeking applications to host the TEI 2027 conference.**
(The hosts for TEI 2026 have already been decided and will be announced at TEI 2025 in Kraków.)

The TEI-C attempts to ensure that the annual meeting is held in a variety of locations reflecting the distribution of TEI members and TEI-related activities, with particular interest in institutions that have not previously hosted a TEI Conference and Members’ Meeting. As the TEI community continues to grow globally, the TEI-C is committed to inclusivity. We are also committed to supporting conference settings that are safe and welcoming to all. 

Local organizers at the host institution(s) are responsible for providing facilities for all conference-related activities, including pre-conference workshops and SIG meetings, developing the conference web site, producing a collection of abstracts, organizing a conference dinner, and coordinating appropriate social events. The TEI-C Conference attracts approximately 100-150 participants and spans 3-4 days, depending on the proposals submitted and the workshops offered. The entire event not only includes the conference sessions, but the TEI-C Technical Council often meets for 2 days before the conference, the TEI-C Board has a meeting during the conference, there are usually pre-conference workshops, special interest group meetings, and some conferences have included optional additional social events. 

The conference is entirely financed through conference registration fees, plus a $7,000 USD subvention from the TEI-C, and any contributions that the Local Conference Organising Committee is able to obtain from sponsors.

To apply to host the conference, please **submit a PDF** of a descriptive host application to **James.Cummings@newcastle.ac.uk by 8 September 2025**. The host application requires thorough logistical, timing, fiscal, social attractions, and other information from the prospective meeting host(s) to enable the TEI-C Board of Directors to fully review the applications with special emphasis on:
- the level of support and underwriting (financial and logistical) the institution can offer to ensure the success of the meeting;
- the venue itself and its suitability for a meeting of this size and type;
- the kinds of support the organizers can draw upon locally to ensure the logistical success of the meeting. 

Conference hosts are expected to abide by and help facilitate the TEI-C Code of Conduct at [https://tei-c.org/about/code-of-conduct/](https://tei-c.org/about/code-of-conduct/)). 

Additional information about conference expectations and requirements, including detailed information about the application process can be found at: [http://members.tei-c.org/hosting](http://members.tei-c.org/hosting).

Prospective hosts are invited to discuss their plans informally with members of the TEI-C Board of Directors [https://tei-c.org/about/board-of-directors/](https://tei-c.org/about/board-of-directors/) before submitting an application. Any questions not covered by the hosting page http://members.tei-c.org/hosting may also be sent to James.Cummings@newcastle.ac.uk. 

**Applications are due 8 September 2025**, and will be reviewed by the members of the TEI-C Board of Directors.
