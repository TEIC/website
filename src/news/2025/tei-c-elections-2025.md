## Candidate Statements: TEI Technical Council {#council}

### Helena Bermúdez Sabel {#HBS}

_Affiliation:_ JinnTec

**Statement of purpose:**

I have been serving as a member of the TEI Technical Council since 2021, and I would love to continue the work carried out during these last years. I am the current chair of the Stylesheets Group, and I am a member of the TEI Stylesheets Task Force charged with the development of another TEI ODD processor, and of the TEI Lite 2.0 Working Group which is currently developing a new version of TEI Lite.

Besides having a strong interest in several schema-related aspects as seen by my participation in the endeavours mentioned above, as a linguist, I am very interested in further employing the TEI to model to less common applications, such as graph-based annotations of complex linguistic features, like syntactic analysis and semantic ambiguity. I have ongoing projects focused on the development of automatic converters from the most common formats used by natural language processing tools to TEI, and from TEI to RDF serialization formats.

**Biography:**

I am Head of Digital Editions in JinnTec, which has given me the opportunity to participate in the development of several, very diverse and unique TEI-based edition projects.

I hold a PhD in Medieval Studies from the Universidade de Santiago de Compostela (2019). My doctoral research involved the development of a digital edition model in TEI that enables the quantitative study of linguistic variation through the automatic comparison of witnesses. 

I also have solid experience in Digital Humanities teaching, in particular giving specialised workshops and seminars in digital philology and XML technologies.

My avid interest in data modeling and the formalization of annotation schemes makes me very keen on continuing to have an active role in the TEI community.

### Elli Bleeker {#EB}

_Affiliation:_ Huygens Institute

**Statement of purpose:**

I am pleased to seek re-election to the TEI Technical Council. During my time on Council so far, I have focused on maintaining standards, processing feature requests, resolving bugs, and improving guidelines and documentation. This foundational work remains essential, and I am committed to continuing these efforts. It has also proven to be the best way to acquire a thorough knowledge of the TEI infrastructure — knowledge I plan to make more accessible to new Council members and scholars at all technical levels. If re-elected, I will prioritize contributing to TEI by Example and related educational initiatives such as the SIG Pedagogy. This includes collecting and organizing existing teaching materials while ensuring their long-term accessibility. Additionally, I will continue to refine the encoding guidelines for manuscript description from a genetic perspective, building on the Encoding Model for Genetic Editions (Burnard et al., 2010). Specifically, I will examine how these guidelines can be updated to reflect current developments in shared vocabularies for textual variation.

Serving on the TEI Technical Council is sometimes challenging but always rewarding work. The technical challenges are engaging and instructive, and collaborating with dedicated colleagues makes the role particularly enjoyable. Due to health issues and maternity leave, I was only able to serve the final year of my three-year term, and I am eager to continue the work that has just begun. (Incidentally, I want to acknowledge the Council's understanding and flexibility during my leave of absence—their support reflects the collaborative spirit that makes this community so valuable.) Finally, I am fortunate to have institutional support for my TEI work, which enables me to dedicate the necessary time and resources to Council responsibilities.

**Biography:**

I work as a researcher at the Huygens Institute for the History of the Netherlands and the DHLab of the KNAW Humanities Cluster. The Huygens Institute is a leading European institute in digital scholarly editing and therefore recognizes the value of the TEI, providing institutional support for this kind of work. I have a background in French literature, book history, and manuscript studies, but over the years I've received hands-on training in text modeling, semi-automated collation, and digital scholarly editing. Coming to XML and text encoding from a humanities background rather than a technical one gives me particular insight into the challenges scholars face when learning these technologies, making me well-positioned to contribute to the pedagogical aspects of TEI work.	

### Maria Fronczak {#MF}

_Affiliation:_ Institute of History of the Polish Academy of Sciences

**Statement of purpose:**

I would like to advocate for two causes: first, the development of recommendations for applying the TEI Guidelines; and second, the issues of versioning, citability, and long-term preservation of digital editions.

The flexibility of using the TEI guidelines is a great advantage, but it comes at a price. Less experienced users often struggle with choosing how to encode text; moreover, similar projects may choose different approaches, which reduces the interoperability of encoded data. Furthermore, the lack of clear recommendations for most standard cases negatively impacts the reusability of software solutions for preparing or visualizing digital editions.
There are initiatives to define encoding recommendations for the main types of digital editions, which I find very valuable and inspiring. I believe it is worth pursuing this topic on the TEI Technical Council forum, in dialogue with the community and the teams already working on the issue, in order to develop recommendations for recurring, standard situations, without sacrificing the overall flexibility of the TEI Guidelines.

Working both at a research institute and an academic library, I am acutely aware of the insufficient position of digital editions in scholarly discussions, where outdated print editions are often cited instead of digital editions, which may not be considered as legitimate sources. I see the issues of versioning, citability, and durability of digital editions among the main reasons for this problem. While I realize that those issues are not solely technical, and I do acknowledge that a comprehensive approach is needed, there are also some key technical questions that I would like to raise.

**Biography:**

A graduate of computer science and interfaculty studies in the humanities, currently working at the Institute of History of the Polish Academy of Sciences and the University of Warsaw Library, where she makes use of her vast experience in software engineering when architecting and implementing solutions for scientific research and library operations. She has been involved in several digital humanities and cultural heritage projects, including digital editions projects; and her current responsibilities include preparing the infrastructure for digital editions at the Institute of History of the Polish Academy of Sciences.		

### Joanna Hałaczkiewicz {#JH}

_Affiliation:_ Jagiellonian University (Kraków, Poland)

**Statement of purpose:**

Being nominated to the TEI Consortium Technical Council is a great honor for me. I have gained experience in designing and encoding digital scholarly editions of Polish literature from the contemporary, Renaissance, and Baroque periods. The values I aim to promote in TEI encoding are flexibility, interoperability, and – most importantly – simplicity.

The true richness of the TEI standard – namely, its ability to encode a wide variety of data – can also be overwhelming for scholars at the early stages of their Digital Humanities journey. As a member of the Technical Council, I would like to support the community of TEI beginners and especially encourage researchers who are skeptical of Digital Humanities to explore the broader possibilities offered by the TEI standard.

I am particularly interested in developing multimodal publishing workflows, where digital scholarly editions are developed in parallel with printed materials and e-books, playing an integral role in the overall publication process. Another area of my interest involves the application of artificial intelligence to automate editorial tasks such as transliteration, text modernization, and annotation.

**Biography:**

I am an assistant at the Faculty of Polish Studies at the Jagiellonian University, holding a PhD in literary studies. I combine teaching – in the fields of textual criticism, editing, and publishing studies – with research, as a member of the LabEdyt (Laboratory of Digital Editing) team at the Jagiellonian Centre for Digital Humanities.

I am involved in several digital scholarly edition projects, including an edition of Szymon Laks’s correspondence with Krystyna and Czesław Bednarczyk (1975–1983), an edition of the homiletic works of Piotr Skarga (16th century), an edition of a manuscript containing Baroque poetry by Wacław Potocki („Moralia”), Neolatina Sarmatica (a digital repository of critical editions of Latin texts authored by writers associated with the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth), and a web platform dedicated to the history of the 20th-century Polish publishing house in London: Poets' and Painters' Press – Oficyna Poetów i Malarzy.

### Dario Kampkaspar {#DK}

_Affiliation:_ University and State Library Darmstadt

**Statement of purpose:**

I am excited and honoured to be nominated to stand for the TEI Council and thus contribute to the future of the TEI. For me, this means that while I have certain key interests, I’ll concentrate on what is most needed within the council: the TEI and its bodies are a group effort!

Over the past years and decades, the complexity of the TEI has increased continuously; there can be quite a learning curve, especially as there are often multiple ways of doing things. This is not a downside of the TEI but its strength as it enables its use in many different areas. But it might be helpful to more explicitly outline suggestions how phenomena could be addressed for certain use cases. Hence, one focus for me would be to work towards these kinds of suggestions (which would be a combination of a customization and an expanded documentation) so as to make the first steps in the TEI world easier and improve interoperability.

By now, the model to describe a text’s meta data or the entities (in the broadest sense) related to it, has become very powerful. I would like to work towards a clear distinction of meta data and the actual text (be it transcribed or born digital).
This will strengthen the value of the TEI in describing not only bibliographic meta data but also entities.

Connected to both these efforts is my hope to be able to have a fresh look a many elements’ content models – or, more general, the class system – as there are often elements allowed that do not seem to make many sense. This often stems from an element’s possible use both within the text as well as for describing meta data or entities.
This will be a long task but also help reduce complexity and thus make learning (and teaching) the TEI a lot easier.

I hope that, if elected, I can contribute to the open, fair and inclusive community the TEI is.

**Biography:**

Currently, I am the head of the Centre for Digital Editions at the University and State Library in Darmstadt, Germany. The projects I’m involved in span from in-depth scholarly editions to large corpus building (240 years of newspapers) and mass conversion of different formats to TEI. Also, I am actively contributing to the development of the framework for digital editions used in the library.

My key interests are closely related to this background – the need to keep a large number of projects up and running while making sure that the markup is as consistent as possible.

I hold a degree in (medieval and early modern) history and English linguistics and literature.					

### Naoki Kokaze {#NK}

_Affiliation:_ Chiba University

**Statement of purpose:**

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the nomination for the TEI Technical Council. My work in digital history/humanities with a focus on historical financial records of Japan and Europe has been deeply intertwined with the principles and technologies of the Text Encoding Initiative, and I am eager to contribute more formally to its future development.

I am aware that the TEI Technical Council has historically had limited representation from the Asian research community. I believe my perspective as a researcher based in Japan can bring a valuable new dimension to the Council's work. My participation would not only enhance the Council's international diversity but also offer fresh insights into the unique challenges and opportunities presented by East Asian texts, such as how to best model non-linear or multi-layered text structures common in Japanese historical documents. As detailed in my biography, my extensive, practical experience with TEI has prepared me to contribute effectively to these challenges.

If elected, I am committed to leveraging my background to advance the TEI's mission. I hope to contribute by:

- Acting as a bridge between the TEI and the growing digital humanities community in Asia, fostering greater collaboration and adoption.
- Sharing my expertise in handling complex non-Latin text structures to help ensure the TEI remains a truly global standard.

The TEI Consortium is the most vital community for advancing digital scholarly methods in the humanities. I have the utmost respect for its work and would be honored to dedicate my time and expertise to the Technical Council.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

**Biography:**

I am an Assistant Professor of Digital Humanities at Chiba University, Japan, where I design a postgraduate DH curriculum. I received my MA degree in DH as the Best Overall Student in the MA in Digital Humanities at King's College London 2018/19, focusing on the usability of TEI and semantic web technologies for the analysis of digital history.

I have led a project that involved creating a TEI-based digital scholarly edition of ancient Japanese administrative document, Engi-shiki. In this project, we proposed new tag sets and contributed to the development of `<unitDecl>` and `<unitDef>`, in an article for the Journal of the Text Encoding Initiative, titled *"Toward a Model for Marking up Non-SI Units and Measurements."* Furthermore, I first-authored a paper in the journal of Digital Scholarship in the Humanities on the analysis of early-modern Spanish ledger using TEI/DEPCHA (Digital Edition Publishing Cooperative for Historical Accounts).

Drawing from my experience in structuring and comparing Japanese and European historical accounting records with TEI, my research begins by focusing on the unique characteristics of these primary sources, but my ultimate goal is to derive broader lessons and general insights that are applicable across different cultural contexts.	

### Stephan Kurz {#SK}

_Affiliation:_ Austrian Academy of Sciences, Institute for Habsburg and Balkan Studies

**Statement of purpose:**

For the past six years I have been working on digital scholarly edition projects working with historical sources, with two project teams who I continuously support in their use of the TEI. Both projects have enabled me to profit from as well as contribute to the TEI community in offline and online channels. This extended my knowledge of the TEI Guidelines, which was previously limited to scholarly edition practice of literary works. This focus has necessitated lots of extra-textual knowledge about `person`s, `place`s, `org`s and, importantly, `event`s and their `relation`s. 

My goal during a term on the TEI Technical Council would be to finalize previous work on `event` in conjunction with the other ›-ographies‹ (i.e. `standOff` descendant elements and their in-`text` relatives). 

I would be honored to return the lots of favours the TEI community has done me since 2008, by taking the time to more actively contribute to the Guidelines and the TEI as an organization.

**Biography:**

Working for the Austrian Academy of Sciences’ Institute for Habsburg and Balkan Studies as a technical editor for the ›Ministerratsprotokolle der Habsburgermonarchie 1848–1918‹ edition of governmental documents (in print and on the web), as well as for the ›Digital Scholarly Edition of Habsburg-Ottoman Diplomatic Sources 1500–1918‹ (QhoD) online edition project. Former German studies lecturer at University of Zagreb, Croatia, and University of Vienna, Austria. PhD thesis on German-language epistolary novels (`correspDesc`, but also `objectDesc` and genre theory beyond `textClass`). Experience in the book trade (financed my studies by working in proofreading, copyediting, graphic design, typesetting, publishing, a large digitization project at a university library, as well as at a bookseller’s). Accustomed to organizational matters through various academic committees and representation of doctoral candidates on national and European level. Typography aficionado, LaTeX (ab)user.

### Patricia O'Connor {#POC}

_Affiliation:_ Independent Researcher

**Statement of purpose:**

When I was elected to the Technical Council three years ago it was my intention to make the TEI documentation more accessible for those encountering the TEI for the first time. In my time as a member of the Technical Council I have updated the Technical Council documentation for Updating the P5 subset. This is a procedure that needs to be completed on a monthly basis by a Council member. I assumed responsibility for ensuring that the documentation aligns with current practice and that the procedure is also accessible for new Council Members who are building the P5 subset for the very first time. I have also updated the documentation for Building a Release, a procedure that is vital for the release of future versions of the TEI Guidelines. As one of the assistant release technicians for the previous release of the TEI Guidelines, I volunteered to correct the documentation to guarantee that it is accurate and avoids any unnecessary delays for future releases. Additionally, I created a cheat sheet or a beginners guide for the new Technical Council members that are unfamiliar with git or the command line. For the past three years I have gained invaluable experience in maintaining and updating the TEI Guidelines, including deprecating elements and updating content models. I am also a new member of the EpiDoc Action Group, a group that is dedicated to maintaining guidelines for Epigraphic Documents in TEI XML and I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to represent the EpiDoc Action Group on the TEI Technical Council and facilitate collaboration between the TEI and EpiDoc communities. I have had the great honour and privilege to learn from more experienced Council members and I seek re-election to the Technical Council so that I could continue learning about and actively contributing to the maintenance of the TEI Guidelines.

**Biography:**

I specialise in text encoding, and my experience with TEI encompasses early medieval manuscripts, 19th century correspondence, as well as Celtic inscriptions. Currently, I am responsible for encoding ogham inscriptions across Ireland and Britain in EpiDoc TEI-XML format in accordance with the EpiDoc Guidelines for the joint OG(H)AM project between Maynooth and Glasgow universities. I have also worked with Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) technology and the eScriptorium platform for fire-damaged medieval manuscripts as part of the RESCAPÉ and PRAIRIE projects at the École nationale des chartes. For the ‘Transatlantic Intellectual Networks’ project at Newcastle University, I transcribed, edited, and encoded 19th century correspondence in TEI-XML. As part of the ‘A Consolidated Library of Anglo-Saxon Poetry’ (CLASP) project at Oxford University, I produced transcriptions of Old English and Anglo-Latin poetic texts. I look forward to expanding my knowledge and experience by participating in future TEI and EpiDoc projects.

I hold a Digital Humanities PhD from University College Cork. My doctoral research was focused on creating a digital documentary edition of an early eleventh century Old English manuscript witness of the Old English Bede and its marginalia. I am committed to developing my knowledge of TEI. I was the co-instructor for the introductory workshop on ‘Building Digital Editions with the TEI’ at University College Cork (2023). At the École nationale des chartes (2024), I was a co-instructor on the postgraduate module ‘Structuring XML and TEI-XML’. I am also a co-instructor for the ‘Navigating and Processing Data from the TEI with XPath and XSLT’ workshop at the TEI 2025 conference in Krakow. During my PhD, summer schools such as the 'Medieval and Modern Manuscript Studies in the Digital Age' summer school at Cambridge University Library (CUL) and King’s College London (2016) were invaluable for providing in-depth training in text encoding and I hope to continue  expanding the TEI community by teaching TEI-XML at workshops and summer schools. I am a newly appointed member of the EpiDoc Action Group and I am also the Digital Officer for the Teachers of Old English in Britain and Ireland (TOEBI), and would be delighted to promote the activities of the TEI Technical Council in both of these roles.													

### Ariane Pinche {#AP}

_Affiliation:_ CNRS

**Statement of purpose:**

First of all, I am deeply honored to be considered for a position on the TEI Technical Council. I am a medieval philologist at the CNRS, with a strong interest in the digital representation of medieval texts. My engagement with the field of Digital Humanities began with work on TEI-based digital editions.
During my early training on the Hyperdonat project, I was an early adopter of ODD, using it both as an XML schema and to document data modelling decisions. My PhD thesis consisted of a digital edition of Li Confessor by Wauchier de Denain, which involved representing the physical structure of manuscript BnF fr. 412, collating the manuscript tradition and enriching the text with linguistic annotation —all with the aim of producing a rigorously documented scholarly edition. I also integrated the CTS (Canonical Text Service) protocol to ensure compatibility with the CapiTainS ecosystem.
From 2018 to 2021, I taught digital editing (XML-TEI, ODD, and XSLT) at the École nationale des chartes, in the Master's programme Technologies numériques appliquées à l’histoire, where I had previously been a student. Although I now work full-time as a researcher, I remain deeply committed to knowledge transmission. I currently teach digital editing and automatic text transcription to early-career researchers and research support staff, notably at the EnExDi Spring University and in various workshops and training events.
If elected to the Technical Council, I would be honoured to contribute to ongoing discussions around text encoding and the continued evolution of the TEI standard. I am committed to representing the needs of scholars working with manuscripts and to strengthening the dialogue between automated processing workflows and TEI. I would also work to ensure strong connections with the French-speaking community and the networks I am actively involved in, such as Biblissima+, the Consortium Ariane-HN, and Humanistica.

**Biography:**

I am a researcher (chargée de recherche) at the CNRS, working in medieval studies and digital humanities at CIHAM (UMR 5648) in Lyon. My primary area of research is the vernacular hagiographic tradition, with a particular interest in the circulation and reception of texts across manuscripts and communities. I am especially focused on the mechanisms of compilation in French ‘legendiers’ and on how digital tools can help us better understand their structure and transmission. To explore these large and complex corpora, I have been involved in the development of automatic handwriting recognition models for medieval manuscripts, notably within the international project CATMuS (Consistent Approaches to Transcribing ManuScripts). This work has led me to reflect on the ways in which the TEI standard can support semi-automatic editorial workflows – from transcription to enriched, layered textual representations that allow for multiple levels of interpretation.

### Klaus Rettinghaus {#KR}

**Statement of purpose:**

I am honored to have been nominated for the Technical Council. As a musicologist and developer, I have been working on and with TEI for many years. I have contributed to several digital editions and served as a reviewer for the Journal of the Text Encoding Initiative. For several years I have been an active member of the Correspondence SIG and have also participated in the development of the TEI schema. This community is open and welcoming and I would be happy to actively contribute to the Council with my technical expertise in any possible way.	

**Biography:**

Klaus studied physics in Berlin. After graduating, he studied musicology, LIS and theology at the Humboldt University in Berlin. He received his doctorate in 2012 with a thesis on Otto Nicolai's sacred works. From 2011, he was a research assistant at the Saxon Academy of Sciences in Leipzig, where he also worked on the Bach digital project. From 2020, he was employed as a developer at the Berlin start-up Enote. He worked as a lecturer at the Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy University of Music and Theater in Leipzig. He was a board member of the Music Encoding Initiative and is also a member of its technical team. Klaus works as an editor and develops tools for the digital humanities and is especially interested in exchange formats.	

### Yifan Wang {#YW}

_Affiliation:_ International Institute for Digital Humanities, Tokyo

**Statement of purpose:**

Throughout my academic life, I have been always fascinated by “notation”, which includes writing, language, data, format, or their interactions. Then, working for years on ancient Buddhist texts, I become more and more interested in transmission and transformation of human knowledge across times, languages, and technologies, which is not unlike the recent movement from paper to digital data. For a TEI user who has learned linguistics, philology, translation, and programming—and perhaps most importantly, who was an XML kid in the middle school—I am honoured to have a chance to serve on and learn further from TEI, a digital and global infrastructure for the current and future humanities research.

Leveraging my knowledge, I would commit myself to expanding usability and applicability of TEI, especially on better support of scripts, languages, and disciplines from East Asian, Indic, or other regional academic spheres in the Guidelines. I would find the way through discussion and coordination with the Initiative’s working groups, SIGs, as well as other experts and communities, local or technical, to knowing and fulfilling each own basic requirements in TEI. The Guidelines are already a vast accumulation of the common assets by past and current great contributors. I am ready to help, as a member familiar with the standard drafting process, enrich them to be even more universal by incorporating, and harmonizing with, previously unaccounted fields.

**Biography:**

Currently, a Fellow at the International Institute for Digital Humanities, as well as a (very close) PhD candidate in library and information sciences at the University of Tokyo, awaiting defense at the time of writing. My BA and MA degrees are in linguistics. My research interests are around written languages, informatics of scripts, and writing system studies, while my PhD thesis focuses on medieval Han script variant characters (practised in China, Korea, and Japan). Involved for ten years in the SAT project (SAT Daizōkyō Text Database Committee), mainly working on digitalization of the Taishō Tripiṭaka (a compilation of Chinese Buddhist scriptures) and research of medieval character dictionaries. An active member in standardization processes: ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 2 (as IRG expert) for ISO/IEC 10646 (Universal coded character set) and the Unicode Standard, ISO/TC 37 (as delegate and WG expert) for ISO 639 (ISO language code), ISO 21646, and related standards. Also a freelance translator and a L10N/i18n engineer mainly in the field of video games.

## Candidate Statements: TEI Board {#board}

### Dimitra Grigoriou {#DG}

_Affiliation:_ Instistute for Habsburg and Balkan Studies, Austrian Academy of Sciences

**Statement of purpose:**

In my current role, I am fortunate to contribute to a diverse range of digital humanities projects centered on digital editions and the application of TEI/XML. This work not only deepens my technical expertise but allows me to actively support and guide colleagues in the use of the TEI and its guidelines. Through this collaborative environment, I have come to appreciate the importance of fostering a strong, supportive TEI community—one that is accessible, inclusive, and forward-looking.

I am passionate about maintaining, supporting, and advancing the TEI standard by helping to develop practical solutions that respond directly to the evolving needs of editors and researchers. My goal is to make TEI not just a technical standard, but a flexible, user-centered tool that empowers scholars at every stage of their digital editing journey.

Beyond my technical engagement, I have a strong interest in pedagogy and mentorship. I actively promote the introduction of TEI/XML to early-career scholars and students through teaching, training sessions, and internships. I believe that introducing young researchers to structured text encoding is key to ensuring the future vitality of digital scholarship. Equally important is fostering ongoing dialogue between scholars in the humanities, bridging gaps between disciplines, and nurturing a spirit of collaboration.

If elected, I will dedicate myself to expanding awareness of TEI across diverse academic and cultural communities. I aim to develop more accessible training opportunities, encourage inclusive participation regardless of experience level, and amplify the voices of users who wish to contribute to the continued evolution of the TEI Guidelines. I believe the TEI community thrives when it reflects a wide range of perspectives and use cases—and I am committed to ensuring that this vision becomes a reality.
