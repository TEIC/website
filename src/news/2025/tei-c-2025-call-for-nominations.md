# TEI-C Call for Nominations 2025

The Text Encoding Initiative Consortium (TEI-C) invites nominations for election to the TEI-C Board and the Technical Council -- join us!


The following positions are vacant and up for election:

_TEI-C Board_

* 1 member (for 3-year term)

_TEI-C Council_

* 3 members (for 3-year term)

The TEI-C seeks to represent its community and encourages diversity and gender balance in all its constituencies. Do you think you might be a good fit? Do you know someone who you think might strengthen and expand the community? We welcome both nominations of others and self-nominations. You may make multiple nominations.

Please submit your nominations to the TEI-C Board Nominating Committee via [this form](https://forms.gle/UxxSFvTS3k9keSD87) by  June 6th, 2025. 
You will be asked for the name and contact details of your nominee. 

## Information and Process

TEI-C membership is not a requirement to serve on the Board or Council. All nominees are reminded that it is the duty of members of both bodies to participate actively in the discussion, activities, and meetings of their respective bodies. Descriptions of the responsibilities of both Board and Council can be read below. Feel free to contact us at chair AT tei-c.org for more information.

Nominees (whether you are nominating yourself or someone else) will be contacted, asked if they accept the nomination, and if so to provide a brief bio and statement of interest. The contacting process will occur as nominations are received.

The elections will take place via online voting prior to the 2025 Membersâ€™ Meeting in September. Elections will be announced at the meeting.

Once again, use this [nomination form](https://forms.gle/UxxSFvTS3k9keSD87) to nominate yourself or someone else.

### TEI-C Board

The TEI-C Board is the governing body for the TEI Consortium and is responsible for its strategic and financial oversight. The Board conducts its business by email correspondence, monthly teleconferences, and at its annual meeting, for which travel subsidies are available. For more information on the Board, including a list of current members, please see: [Board of Directors](https://tei-c.org/about/board-of-directors/).

### TEI-C Technical Council

The TEI-C Technical Council oversees the technical development of the TEI Guidelines. Candidates for Council should be reasonably experienced users of the Guidelines, and expertise/interest in specific areas is helpful. Council members also evaluate bug reports and feature requests, and they have primary responsibility for editing and updating the Guidelines and its release packages. Prospective candidates should be available for subsidized travel to one or two face-to-face meetings annually, and they should be able to commit to ongoing work during the course of the year. For more information on the Council, including a list of current members, please see: [Technical Council](https://tei-c.org/activities/council/).
