# 2025 Winners of the Rahtz Prize and Community Prize

The TEI Consortium is pleased to announce the winners of the 2025 Rahtz Prize for TEI Ingenuity and the TEI Community Award.

The winner of the 2025 Rahtz Prize for TEI Ingenuity is [LEAF-Writer](https://leaf-writer.leaf-vre.org/) by Susan Brown, James Cummings, Luciano Frizzera, 
Mihaela Ilovan, and Diane Jakacki. The Rahtz Prize committee found the LEAF-Writer project 
to be “remarkable for the careful and thorough development of software that anyone involved with TEI would deem necessary, 
yet no one had been able to develop before. Additionally, its integration with Linked Open Data is crucial for the progressive use of TEI data, 
and the fact that it facilitates this so seamlessly is truly innovative.”

The winner of the 2025 Community Prize is [The Endings Project](https://endings.uvic.ca/) by Claire Carlin, 
Ewa Czaykowska-Higgins, Janelle Jenstad, Elizabeth Grove-White, Corey Davis, John Durno, Lisa Goddard,
J. Matthew Huculak, Martin Holmes, Stewart Arneil, Greg Newton, and Joey Takeda. The committee described The Endings Project
as “one of the most significant contributions to scholarly digital publishing of the last decade, regularly mentioned in Digital Humanities venues 
supporting the longevity and preservation of DH projects. This project is distinguished by its extension of TEI values far beyond our community.”

This year’s Rahtz and Community Prize Committee consisted of Elisa Beshero-Bondar, Kiyonori Nagasaki, and Raffaele Viglianti.

Congratulations to this year's winners and sincere thanks to the wider TEI Community for your continued efforts to develop, maintain, and expand the TEI Guidelines.
