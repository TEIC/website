# Rahtz Prize for Ingenuity 2025 — Call for nominations and self\-submissions


The TEI Consortium created the Rahtz Prize for TEI Ingenuity in memory of Sebastian Rahtz, who contributed significantly to the TEI infrastructure. The award is intended to honour Sebastian’s noteworthy technical and philosophical contributions to the TEI, and to encourage innovation in the TEI community. The Rahtz Prize for TEI Ingenuity is awarded to an individual or team judged to have made a significant contribution to the TEI-C’s mission in particular by means of non-commercial/openly-available projects or initiatives. Many members of the TEI community are engaged in exploring new ways of implementing and expanding the coverage of the TEI encoding system. It is hoped that the Rahtz Prize will not only recognize excellent work already completed, but through its celebration and dissemination of nominated works also encourage new projects and fresh approaches. The recipient(s) of the 2025 award will receive $1,000 USD or equivalent.


Nominations and self\-submissions should only be submitted through [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSerbrDP3Gs9BGBwLjRN32hT5aSHcpVhdKDyCO6CqMAPI1ZCZA/viewform).


The form will allow both nominations of other people’s projects and submissions of your own projects. Nominators and submitters will be asked to provide their name and contact details for the record and to ensure they are not robots. These data will not be published or otherwise shared, and will only be used for running the award process.
