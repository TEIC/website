# TEI Conference and Members Meeting 2026: Call for Proposals

We are pleased to announce the call for papers, posters, panels, and workshops for the 26th annual meeting of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). Co-hosted by the University of British Columbia and Simon Fraser University, TEI 2026 will be held **August 10–14, 2026** (Mon-Fri) at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/), Vancouver, BC, Canada on the unceded, unsurrendered, traditional and ancestral territories of the [xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam)](https://www.musqueam.bc.ca/our-story/our-territory/) people.

We welcome submissions to do with any aspect of text encoding and digital textual scholarship. This year’s theme—Creating Connections, Unsettling Practices—invites scholars, researchers, and practitioners to explore the past, present, and future of the TEI. Grounded in a commitment to anti-racist, feminist, and decolonial practices, TEI 2026 encourages participants to reflect critically on the structures, collaborations, tools, and methods that variously animate, sustain, modify, or challenge digital textual scholarship today. See the [full CFP](https://tei2026.tei-c.org/CFP.html) for a list of potential topics. 

All proposals are due **February 19, 2026**. Further information and submission details can be found on the conference website: [https://tei2026.tei-c.org](https://tei2026.tei-c.org/). 

On behalf of the entire TEI 2026 conference team, we look forward to welcoming you to Vancouver in August! 

**Local Organizers:** Mary Chapman (UBC); Katherine Bowers (UBC); Sydney Lines (UBC); Rebecca Dowson (SFU)  
**Program Committee:** Emily Christina Murphy (UBCO); Joey Takeda (SFU)
