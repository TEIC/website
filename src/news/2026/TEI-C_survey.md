The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) Consortium is conducting a survey concerning membership and activities of the consortium. You do not need to be a member to answer it.

The TEI Consortium is a non-profit membership organization. All income it receives goes back into the activities of the Consortium. This includes expenses such as a subvention to help run the annual conference (to which TEI members get a discount), a couple of crucial face-to-face meetings for the TEI Technical Council, the Rahtz Prize, and other expenses. The members of the TEI Technical Council and TEI Board of Directors are all volunteers elected directly by the TEI Consortium membership. 

We would like to get your opinions concerning membership levels, fees, and activities of the consortium. Please fill in the form at: (https://forms.gle/USoesRx9SztUqY1j7)[https://forms.gle/USoesRx9SztUqY1j7]. The survey will close 1 March 2026.

(Although we ask for your email address this is solely to encourage you to fill it in only once. We will not spam you with results, they will be posted here.)
