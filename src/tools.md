# Tools

Tools for creating, editing, transforming, and publishing TEI documents and schemas
are essential to using the TEI Guidelines. Since the TEI rules and recomendations
are expressed in XML, TEI users can take advantage of the abundance of XML tools developed
for general use. In addition, the TEI community develops and distributes TEI-specific
tools.

Some tools are maintained and distributed directly by the TEI: for instance, the Roma
tool for schema customization is an integral part of the publication of the TEI Guidelines,
though the underlying tool may also be installed and used separately. Similarly, the
stylesheets that are used by the TEI itself to convert TEI documents into various
formats are distributed here for use and adaptation by others. Tools maintained by
the TEI are described in more detail below and are open-source, [made available under the terms and conditions of both Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike
3.0 Unported License and a BSD 2-Clause license](../Guidelines/access.xml#licensing).

Others tools are contributed by members of the TEI community and are not maintained
by the TEI. These might include tools for authoring and editing, for publishing collections
of TEI documents online, or for generating visualizations of metrical structure. The
community is strongly encouraged to contribute tools that may be generally useful,
to [inventory them on the TEI wiki](https://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/Category:Tools), and to adapt or improve existing tools when allowed under an open-source license.
Note that the TEI does not endorese any particular tool that it does not maintain
and distribute.

There is also a [Special Interest Group on Tools](/activities/SIG/Tools/).

## Generation of schemas and documentation: Roma

[Roma](https://roma.tei-c.org/) is a web-based application which allows TEI users to
generate their own customized P5-compatible schemas and documentation. Roma is useful for all TEI customization
development, whether you want to create a simple TEI schema by selecting a few of
the most relevant TEI modules for your project, or want to do a more complex customization
involving modifications to specific elements. Roma can also help you generate TEI
documentation in languages other than English (for more detail, see the [section on
internationalization below](#I18N)).
 
## Stylesheets for converting TEI documents to various formats

The TEI maintains a library of [XSL stylesheets](https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets), originally developed by Sebastian Rahtz,
which can convert TEI XML files to HTML, LaTeX, or XSL:FO documents. These stylesheets
are designed for specific purposes and are not intended as general-purpose conversion
tools. Other
XSL and CSS stylesheets are listed in the stylesheets section of the [TEI wiki](https://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/Stylesheets), and
all TEI users are encouraged to contribute their own stylesheets to this collection.
 
## Conversion to and from TEI:

[TEIGarage](https://teigarage.tei-c.org/) is a web, and RESTful, service to manage the transformation of documents between
a variety of formats. The majority of transformations use the Text Encoding Initiative
format as a pivot format. It is a good tool for conversion from TEI to Word (.docx),
or Word (.docx) to TEI, but also does many other formats.

## Internationalization of the TEI {#I18N}
 
One important tool developed by the TEI is the system for generating versions of the
Guidelines in languages other than English. This initiative, funded in part by the
[ALLC](http://www.allc.org/), provides a framework for managing translations of the TEI reference documentation,
element names, attribute names and values, and potentially the prose of the TEI Guidelines
themselves. Work is currently under way to translate the reference documentation and
the element and attribute names into five languages: French, Spanish, German, Chinese,
and Japanese. Other languages to be covered in the future if funding and effort permit
include Hindi, Italian, Polish, Romanian, Slovenian, and Tibetan. With this framework
in place, TEI users will be able to generate internationalized versions of the TEI
using the Roma interface described above. Click [here](I18N/) for more information.
