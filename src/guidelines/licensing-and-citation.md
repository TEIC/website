How to Cite the TEI Guidelines
------------------------------


 The canonical release of the TEI Guidelines is the version found at the TEI web site,
 which is kept up to date as new versions are released. A print version of the Guidelines
 may also be produced, but typically only one print version will be published for each
 major release of the Guidelines (P3, P4, P5, and so forth). For citation purposes,
 the question of which version to cite will depend on the purpose of the citation.
 If the goal is to provide a reference to the most current version, the online version
 is preferable. Using the version numbers and (if necessary) the date of last update,
 you can indicate with some precision which state of the Guidelines is being cited;
 however, casual readers may not be able to get access to the precise state you cite,
 if it has been superseded by newer releases. (All previous versions can be recovered
 from the repository maintained at the TEI SourceForge site.) For purposes where a
 stable reference to specific words is crucial, citing the print version (if any) may
 be preferable, with the recognition that it may be out of date with respect to the
 most current online release.
 
 Below are the recommended forms of citation for the TEI Guidelines and its component
 parts, following the recommendations of the Columbia Guide to Online Style. The version number indicates the major release and version (e.g. P5, version 1.0),
 and can be found on the title page for the TEI Guidelines. The last modified date
 is the date on which the Guidelines were last updated and can also be found on the
 title page for the Guidelines; this includes any change that affects the text or substance
 of the Guidelines. The date of access is the date on which the author of the citation
 accessed the page in question.
