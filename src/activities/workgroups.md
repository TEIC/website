# Workgroups



 The main purpose of a TEI Workgroup is to formally recommend extensions or
 modifications to the TEI Guidelines. Workgroups are not the only mechanism for
 proposing extensions or modifications to the Guidelines. Council decided at its
 meeting in April 2008 in Galway to rely on SIGs when possible in order to involve
 a
 broader community of users. Furthermore, users of the TEI are always welcome to
 submit feature requests and bug reports through SourceForge.
 
 The following workgroups are currently active under the aegis of the TEI
 Council:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[TEI Lite 2.0 Workgroup](/activities/workgroups/lite2-charge)
* This group was charged in December 2024 to provide a new version of TEI Lite. The work comprises the provision of extensive and context-rich encoding examples, the revision of the TEI Lite Guidelines, the selection of TEI Lite 2.0 elements, the proposal of a declarative syntax for context-dependent content models, and the preparation of a TEI Lite 2.0 schema customization.

[GIS Workgroup](/activities/workgroups/gis-charge)
* This group was charged in January 2024 to provide standards-informed mechanisms that are at least interchangeable, if not interoperable, for encoding geographic information in TEI that are capable of unambiguous interpretation and transformation to and from standard GIS file formats. 

[TEI Stylesheets Task Force (ATOP)](/activities/workgroups/tei-stylesheets-task-force-charge/)
* This group was charged in March 2022 with rewriting the current set of XSLT stylesheets that tackle ODD processing for generation of schemas and documentation.
 It is aimed at converting ODD to the TEI Guidelines, schemas, and customization ODDs
 into schemas and customized output.

[Internationalization (I18n) Workgroup](/activities/workgroups/internationalization-i18n-workgroup/)
* This group was charged in March 2020 with communicating the TEI to a multilingual
 user community. This comprises the development of a) internationalized and localized
 landing pages for the TEI site, b) a multilingual glossary of TEI terminology for
 both translators and users, and c) a curated repository of multilingual and multicultural
 examples.


The following workgroups have concluded their activity:
-------------------------------------------------------


[Text Directionality Workgroup](https://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/Text_Directionality_Workgroup)
* + This group tasked by the TEI Council with developing a new section for the
	 Guidelines on recommendations for encoding a variety of textual features related
	 to text directionality and orientation.


TEI Pointer/Stand-off Markup Working Group
* + The TEI Pointer/Stand-off Markup Working Group (Gabriel Bodard, Martin Holmes,
	 Piotr Ba≈Ñski, Laurent Romary, Syd Bauman, and Hugh Cayless) will eventually propose
	 to TEI Technical Council that the specifications of the various pointer and XPointer
	 methods in the Guidelines be improved, both (a) by the addition of
	 concrete examples of the use of TEI pointer and other schemes, and some
	 guidance as to which are appropriate in different contexts (and indeed
	 in combination), and (b) by technical description, including examples,
	 of precisely what an implementation of the TEI pointer schemes is
	 expected to do.


Task Force for TEI Tite
* This group (Kevin Hawkins, Perry Trolard, and Greg Suprock) was charged in
 September 2010 with realigning the version of Tite used by Apex CoVantage
 with the canonical version maintained in SourceForge and overseeing ongoing
 evolution of Tite. Proposals are being made in SourceForge.


Ad-hoc committee on TEI for Google Books
* + This group (James Cummings, Martin Holmes, Kevin Hawkins, and Laurent Romary)
	 was charged in September 2011 with providing guidance to an engineer from Google
	 who is working on adding TEI as an export format for Google Books. Its work was taken
	 over by the TEI
	 sub-group of the Google Library Quality working group (composed of representatives
	 of Google's Library
	 Partners).


[Ad-hoc Committee on Encoding of Bibliographic Citations](https://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/Ad-hoc_committee_on_encoding_of_bibliographic_citations)
* + This subgroup of the Council (Martin Holmes, Kevin Hawkins, and Laurent
	 Romary) was charged in February 2010 with writing a proposal to make it
	 clear how to use biblScope for various types of bibliographic citations. The
	 committee has expanded its mission to include a clarification on recommended
	 use of bibl, biblStruct, and biblFull and their child elements. It completed its work
	 in March 2013.
