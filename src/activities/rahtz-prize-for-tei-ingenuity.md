# Rahtz Prize for TEI Ingenuity

About the Rahtz Prize
---------------------

The TEI Consortium has created the Rahtz Prize for TEI Ingenuity in memory of [Sebastian Rahtz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Rahtz "Sebastian Rahtz") (13 February 1955 – 15 March 2016\). The award is intended to honour Sebastian’s major
 technical and philosophical contributions to the TEI, and to encourage TEI innovation
 by the TEI community.
Sebastian was responsible for the design and implementation of a great deal of the
 TEI's technical infrastructure. Within the TEI community he was best known for the
 creation and maintenance of the XSLT Stylesheets that underlie much TEI conversion
 work, customization, and schema generation. As a member of both the TEI's Technical
 Council and its Board, he helped shape the direction of the Consortium.
The Rahtz Prize for TEI Ingenuity is awarded to an individual or team judged to have
 made a significant contribution to the [TEI\-C's mission](https://tei-c.org/about/mission/ "TEI-C's mission") in particular by means of non\-commercial/openly\-available projects or initiatives.
 Many members of the TEI Community are engaged in exploring new ways of implementing
 and expanding the coverage of the TEI system. It is hoped that this Prize will not
 only recognize excellent work already completed, but also encourage new projects and
 fresh approaches.
