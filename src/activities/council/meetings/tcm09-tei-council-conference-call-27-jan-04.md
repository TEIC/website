# TCM09: TEI Council Conference Call 27 Jan 04



The following were present: Syd Bauman (SB), Alejandro Bia (AB),
 David Birnbaum (DB) in part, Lou Burnard (LB), Matthew Driscoll (MD),
 David Durand (DD), Tomaz Erjavec (TE), Julia Flanders (JF), Sebastian
 Rahtz (SR), Laurent Romary (LR), Chris Ruotolo (CR; for item 1 only),
 Susan Schreibman (SS), Natasha Smith (NS), Edward Vanhoutte (EV),
 Perry Willett (PW), Christian Wittern (CW) (and an unnamed rock band).
 


Reporting on the status of the Migration Task Force, CR
 said that the deliverables were all but complete. She anticipated two further
 weeks work were needed to integrate some text from the Editors and to
 complete the Tools page. Scripts and stylesheets from case studies
 needed some work. As regards dissemination, two conference proposals
 had been submitted so far. Some funding remained, which 
 might be used to implement an online conversion service of some
 kind. Council members suggested that future maintenance of the project
 report might be integrated with information about migration from P4 to
 P5\.
 
 Actions from [previous meeting](https://www.tei-c.org/tcm08-tei-council-conference-call-23-sep-03/) were reviewed: 
 
 + AB to promote multilingual markup SIG: action completed; work
 now ongoing in Meta workgroup
+ SR (et al) to consult membership on P5 changes: partially
 completed.
+ LB to update web page indexes with date of last component change;
 technically complex; action abandoned.
+ SB to find out about council membership terms: he had discovered
 the by laws were ambiguous on this, and proposed an amendment to the Board


SR presented a [a report from Metaworkgroup](https://www.tei-c.org/Vault/Workgroups/META/mew09.html) which summarized the current state of P5 work and
 asked for Council's endorsement of the direction taken in
 defining the new ODD format. He
 also drew attention to [a list of specificproposals](https://www.tei-c.org/Vault/Workgroups/META/mew07.html) which the group wished to refer to Council for
 decision. Council noted that documentation of how the new ODD format
 should be deployed was still needed: LB is working on this; the
 current P5TD chapter simply describe the tags used. Some council
 members had already tried Roma and wished to provide feedback: it was agreed that
 this should be rolled out for user testing and feedback as soon as
 possible.
 SRasap to set up mailing list for discussion
 of Roma development. Turning to MEW07, Council reviewed its
 proposals as follows
 
 + Naming convenion: agreed
+ Support for user mods in languages other than RNG : Council
 recognised that this might be technically difficult, and also that it
 was unclear to what extent there would be any demand for it. It was
 suggested that the matter needed further investigation by Meta
 workgroup, and agreed that better documentation for writers of user mods
 would help: this might come via the proposed mailing list.
+ Review of attribute values to use W3C datatypoes: agreed
+ Replacement of text\-valued attributes by 
 choice element
 or equivalent: discussed at some length. Concern was expressed about
 retaining support for existing, comparatively simple, mechanisms where
 possible. LB agreed to review the options again.
+ Use macros or classes to express content models: agreed
+ Make element names unique: agreed
+ Drop concept of auxiliary DTD: agreed. Noted that discussion of
 namespace was not really relevant here.
+ Need to verify equivalence of P4 and P5 outputs: agreed
+ Move to using P5 Odds as maintenance source as soon as possible:
 agreed


 Finally, returning to MEW08, Council agreed :\-
 
 + that the proposed namespace should be
 adopted
+ that conformant documents should specify the version of the TEI
 to which they conform by means of an attribute named
 
 version
+ that its value should follow the pattern
 
 major.minor.micro, with numeric values.
+ that guidelines on version numbering should be agreed by the
 editors and documented asap


* CW presented an update from the Character set workgroup: there
 had been little activity since the [Nancy meeting](https://www.tei-c.org/Vault/Workgroups/CE/cem02.html) until
 recently. A working paper in ODD NG had been circulated very recently,
 and was yet to be discussed by the group. A revision of the proposed
 new draft for chapter 4 was also still in progress. At the Nancy
 meeting, it had been decided to recommend use of 
 xml:lang as a
 replacement for the global 
 lang. Noting that
 this decision might be controversial, and might also have forward
 compatibility issues, Council recommended that a clear rationale for
 the decision be presented as soon as possible. CW said that it was
 hoped to have final versions for discussion at the next council
 meeting in March

* DD gave an update on the Standoff Markup workgroup. Progress on
 recommendations for Xpointer had been stalled by the decision of
 W3C not to expand its syntax further to include several necessary
 features. The workgroup was hoping to develop recommendations in this
 area in the context of another ISO TC37/SC4 activity, but this was
 only just starting to get underway. Concern was expressed that P5
 should not be delayed as a consequence. Council recommended that the
 workgroup should finalize its recommendations as far as possible
 within the context of the existing W3C xpointer() facilities, possibly with some
 clearly distinguished suggested enhancements that might form the basis
 of future work in the ISO context. DD was requested to produce a
 report on current status asap. 
 DD1 Marchcirculate status report
 to Council by email

* LR reported on the joint ISO/TEI activity on feature structures,
 which would be meeting next week to finalize their current draft. The
 whole document needed to be converted to ODD NG format; and it was
 also necessary to ensure that the document still conformed to ISO
 norms. Half of the document was derived more or less verbatim from
 the existing ODDs, and it seemed likely therefore that this would be
 ready for consideration as part of P5\. The other half was
 tutorial matter which would not be appropriate for P5 in any case.

* Council discussed John Smith's proposal to form a workgroup on problems of word
 division in Sanskrit. CW felt that the
 problem area did not relate solely to Sanskrit, and was not really about
 character encoding but rather about linguistic analysis. SR noted that
 the output from the proposal would not be a new module, but at most
 one or two new elements, or recommendations about how to use existing
 ones, such as a SIG might produce. On balance, Council felt that the most
 appropriate course would be to set the group up as a task force
 reporting to Council. 
 CW1 Mar to liaise further with
 John Smith on proposed task force

* Noting that there were a number of related issues to do with the
 public perception and marketing of the TEI, it was proposed that some
 form of marketing committee be set up, drawn from members of the Board and
 Council. 
 CW? to draft terms of reference and structure for
 marketing group to Board

* Discussion of how the budget should be allocated was deferred
 due to lack of time. CW requested that bids for funding from existing or
 proposed workgroups should reach him by the end of February. 
 All1 Mar 04 submit proposals for funding
 from Council budget to CW

* It was agreed to aim for another conference call towards the end
 of March; suggested dates were 23rd and 30th.
 
 CW15 Feb to confirm date
 of next council call
