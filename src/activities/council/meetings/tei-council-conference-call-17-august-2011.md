 Item 1: Vote of no confidence in Chair of TEI
 
 A purely factual overview was presented by LB of the sequence of events of the Board
 meeting held on 11 August 2011, where a vote of no confidence in the chair was
 carried.


The Council expressed great surprise and shock at the suddenness of this vote. It
 noted that among members of the TEI community there seemed to be a strong body of
 support for some of the ideas that Martin Mueller had expressed in a “vision
 document” shared with both Board and Council shortly before the meeting. MH and EP
 asked for more information concerning what had led to the vote, if it was not the
 ideas in that document. LR and LB confirmed that there was opposition to some of
 Martin’s ideas and methods on the Board, and that his work had been made quite
 difficult at times as a consequence. This development however was entirely unexpected
 by the TEI Council and community. The Council felt that the unilateral manner in
 which the vote of no confidence was implemented seemed symptomatic of other
 difficulties that exist between the Board and Council and that the TEI community was
 not always equally well\-reflected by those institutions. JC suggested that greater
 transparency between Board and community with regard to the selection of Martin as
 chair might have helped. GB expressed concern that four people only had been
 available to vote on such an important issue. JN seconded both comments. LB said that
 the Board had acted with due diligence in selecting Martin as chair, and is doing
 so
 also with the selection of an interim chair. This interim chair will hopefully
 continue to address the concerns raised by the previous chair’s vision document.


The council expressed frustration at the lack of communication that exists between
 it
 and the board; notwithstanding our different missions it is imperative that we
 communicate on matters of joint interest and import. Council expressed much regret
 that it was not made aware of the impending vote of no confidence. EP asked for
 greater communication between the Board and the Council, as both are appointed as
 representatives of the community. The lack of communication coupled with the actions
 of the board was seen as a sign that it was acting as a cohort of individuals rather
 than as representatives of the TEI community. LR noted that he was the liaison for
 the Council with the Board and that one of Martin’s proposals was that some aspects
 of the Board and Council could be merged. The participation of the then Chair of the
 TEI Board at the TEI Council meeting in Chicago earlier this year signaled a greater
 participation, which was welcomed. LR noted that while some operational change is
 necessary and might be more beneficial than carrying on with the same infrastructure,
 this needed to be balanced against the benefit that comes from the Council’s capacity
 to work independently of the Board. MH appreciated the manner in which the existence
 of the Board shielded his work on Council from being distracted by too many political
 issues. GB agreed that this was a good thing, but only when the system is functioning
 in a manner representative of the TEI community. It was felt that solely having the
 minutes, which usually aren’t announced to the TEI\-L, was not enough. 


Given the damage to the reputation of the TEI Board in the community EP mooted the
 possibility of asking the entire board to be up for election at the member’s meeting.
 This was not that any particular individual should resign but that all positions
 should be up for election. After discussion it was decided that the potential
 disadvantages of this would outweigh the advantages, especially from the perspective
 of institutional memory and continuity. A sadness was expressed by some at a loss
 of
 faith in the infrastructure of the TEI, perhaps related to the small number of voting
 members participating in the elections by comparison with the size and maturity of
 the TEI community, as noted by LB. The TEI Council, though also elected, operates
 more in the style of an open source community than does the Board and it is possible
 to imagine a future where the Council increasingly moved to this sort of model. LR
 noted that we should discuss what measures are necessary to facilitate the continued
 community development of the TEI. The widespread reaction expressed by members of
 the
 TEI community on social networking sites had been partly negative, viewing all TEI
 activities as tarred with the same brush. But it was also partly seen as reassuring
 \-\- despite low membership numbers, the TEI is highly valued and matters to people.
 


The Council reflected on the need to revise the current overly\-hierarchical structure
 of the TEI as an organization. We need to find a way of operating in which both Board
 and Council can continue to do their jobs while ensuring that the needs of the
 community will be respected. 


We agreed that a short statement of our concerns should be widely circulated, based
 on text initially circulated by JC prior to the meeting. This is the revised text
 of
 that statement:



Dear TEI community and board,
  Following the recent events, the TEI council
 discussed the issue on a telephone conference yesterday and wished unanimously to
 express the following statement.


\= A statement from the TEI Technical Council on the recent actions of the TEI
 Board of Directors \=


The TEI Technical Council is shocked and saddened by the sudden actions at the TEI
 Board of Directors which led to the resignation of its chair and the implications
 this may have for the ability of the TEI Board of Directors to work effectively as
 representatives of the TEI community.


The TEI Technical Council appreciated the willingness of the outgoing chair to
 provide a vision for the TEI that could have contributed to reforming the TEI
 Consortium as an organization. We believe that the events announced by the TEI
 Board of Directors on 15 August 2011, pending greater explanation, have caused
 real harm to the TEI Consortium, and we wish to know the Board's plans for
 restoring the Consortium's reputation and good standing in the community.


The TEI Technical Council continues to function and wants to get on with its job
 of improving and openly maintaining the Guidelines and associated systems and
 resources on behalf of the TEI community. We hope that the TEI Board of Directors
 will consider the issues that the outgoing chair raised as it moves forward, and
 we desire a greater transparency and accountability in TEI Board of Directors
 activities, notwithstanding the minutes of meetings it already publishes. We call
 for reforms that introduce mechanisms to make TEI Board of Directors activities
 more transparent and built on greater consultation with the TEI community.



This was discussed on the TEI Council mailing list and circulated as soon as it had
 been ratified by the Council.




 Item 2: Next Release of the Guidelines
 
 The next release of the Guidelines is scheduled to take place before the 2011 members
 meeting in Würzburg. At present LB is at work on a document that sets out how the
 genetic encoding proposals should be integrated into the TEI P5 (especially the
 transcription module). LB will be willing to triage tickets for work before the next
 release, but cannot do so for the next couple of weeks. EP questioned whether council
 wanted to discuss the issues more; JC, not wanting to derail the conversation too
 much, wondered aloud if this would include the contentious potential merging of
 ‘document’ and ‘facsimile’. LB noted that he was working on the proposals as a whole.
 Many of the proposals had already been agreed by Council, but since some were
 contentious he was constructing a detailed proposal document rather than just
 implementing them directly. Council seemed in agreement that this was a good way to
 progress on this since the genetic encoding was something it wanted to see in the
 next release. 


It was requested that council members not only comment on tickets but, where they
 concern a trivial, agreed, or resolved matter, to take the initiative in making
 appropriate changes in the source files too. LB and other Council members pointed
 to
 the documentation on how to do this that was made available after the Chicago 2011
 Council meeting. Council members are requested to go through SourceForge and identify
 an implementable ticket and claim it on the Council mailing list in the next couple
 weeks. If Council members encounter difficulties they should ask on the mailing list
 for assistance. 


A deadline for the next release (the beginning of October) was agreed, so as to allow
 changes before the members meeting. 




 Item 3: Next Face\-to\-Face meeting 
 
 LR spared Council an in\-depth summary of the bureaucratic fight to have a second
 face\-to\-face meeting of the Council. The next face\-to\-face meeting will take place
 in
 Paris from 7\-9 November 2011\. INRIA will provide rooms and coffee breaks and CNRS
 may
 also be contributing. The first half of the meeting will address ticket resolution
 and general Council business; the second half will be dedicated to a small number
 of
 major prospective discussions, some of which were already included in the proposal
 to
 the Board. LR will forward this to the Council mailing list for discussion. One issue
 that was suggested for discussion was how the Council members would cope, e.g. in
 finding sources of funding for travel to face\-to\-face meetings, if the Board was no
 longer in a position to fund these.


LR thanked attendees, noting that the willingness to attend at such a short notice
 spoke volumes for the deep level of commitment TEI Council members felt to the
 community.
