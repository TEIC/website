# Report of the TEI Council Activities to the Members Meeting, 2025

Continuing its long-standing practice, the TEI Technical Council has met regularly this year in monthly 90-minute teleconferences. In addition we hosted one "virtual face-to-face" meeting from  May 18 – 19 and a 27-hour in-person face-to-face meeting at the TEI Conference in Kraków.

Since the last Annual General Meeting in October 2024:

* Council completed and closed:
     * [162 tickets and pull requests](https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues?q=closed%3A%3E2024-10-10%20state%3Aclosed) on the TEI Guidelines repository
     * [79 tickets and pull requests](https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/issues?q=closed%3A%3E2024-10-10%20state%3Aclosed) on the Stylesheets repository.

* Council issued the following releases of the TEI Guidelines:
     * [4.8.1 patch release (2024-11-02)](](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/readme-4.8.1.html)) (a patch to the July '24 "Six Degrees" which introduced the [CMC chapter](https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/CMC.html))
     * [Release 4.9.0 (2024-11-02)](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/readme-4.9.0.html) "The Atocha Release".
          * This release introduced a `<constraintDecl>` element for specifying your Schematron query language binding.
          *  With this release, `@ref` is now valid on `<bibl>`, `<biblfull>`, and `<biblStruct>`.
     * [Release 4.10.0 (2024-08-15)](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/readme-4.10.0.html) "The Olinguito Release", which introduced updates to several content models in the TEI:
          * `model.stageLike` is now permitted in `<sp>`
          * The `<ref>` element is now allowed in `<person>`, `<place>`, `<org>`, and `<event>` elements
          * `<byline>` is now allowed in `<closer>`.
     * [4.10.1](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/readme-4.10.1.html) and [4.10.2](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/readme-4.10.2.html) patch releases were made in early September (most recently, 2025-09-04) to resolve as quickly as possible some bugs discovered in the revised content models from the 4.10 release. 
    
The TEI Stylesheets Co-op group has continued to hold monthly meetings to solve processing problems and update the codebase of the [Stylesheets](https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets).

The following Task Forces were active this year connected with Council activities:

* Another TEI ODD Processor (ATOP): upgrading the processing of customization ODD.

* TEI Lite2 Task Force has begun meeting and developing customizations as a precursor to TEI P6, which we hope to prioritize in 2026.

* At the face-to-face meeting in Kraków, Council brainstormed the possible development of a TEI Technical Contributors program to share specialized training in working with the TEI's code repositories. We have begun discussing this in the TEI Slack and hope to continue discussions and plans over the next year.

* Connected with forward-looking activities, Council is seeking current examples of TEI encoding to help update the [TEI by Example](https://teibyexample.org/exist/TBE.htm) resource hosted at U. Edinburgh. We have circulated [a survey of the TEI community](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=yFCH6vTj9U-kP-iCC-CffhG-TXTdW69IiF3xX4jebBBUMFdBRDFNTU9NM0ZSMklINkhURllCWFozRC4u&route=shorturl) to assist in the effort.
