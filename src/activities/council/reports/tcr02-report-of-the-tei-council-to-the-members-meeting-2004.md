# TCR02: Report of the TEI Council to the Members Meeting 2004


Report of the TEI Council to the Members Meeting 2004
 
 The TEI Council is in charge of overseeing the technical development of the TEI
 Guidelines. This year, all energy was devoted to develop [P5](../../../Guidelines/P5/),
 the next major revision of the Guidelines. The development takes place mainly in the
 workgroups charged by the Council and through the work of the TEI editors. The Council
 held one face to face meeting and five telephone conference calls to discuss reports
 from workgroups and plan for further development. In addition, to further public
 visibility and to be able to serve the needs of the members more directly, an open
 workspace was created at sourceforge.net where TEI users are able to submit and discuss
 proposals for new features of the Guidelines. A more detailed report on the work of
 the
 working groups and task forces active during the past year follows.



 Character Encoding Workgroup
 
 Chaired by Christian Wittern, charged July 2001
This workgroup was charged by the TEI Council to revise those areas of the TEI
 Guidelines that deal with representation of characters, languages and writing
 systems, which includes the current Chapter 4 (Languages and Character Sets) and
 Chapter 25 (Writing System Declaration).


The last meeting of this workgroup was held immediately prior to the Members Meeting
 in Nancy, November 2003\. Some of the more important outcomes of this meeting include
 the decision to recommend to the Council that language identification in TEI
 documents should follow other XML vocabularies and use the xml:lang attribute as
 outlined in the XML recommendation. While there was some discussion afterwards and
 concerns were raised by members who had not been present in Nancy, the decision was
 not reversed and later endorsed by the Council. The workgroup submitted two draft
 documents to the Council for discussion at its meeting in Ghent. All draft documents
 of the workgroup are available from the workgroup area on the TEI web site ([http://www.tei\-c.org/cms/Activities/Workgroups/CE/](http://www.tei-c.org/cms/Activities/Workgroups/CE/)).


Aspects of the workgroup's current proposal were presented at the ACH/ALLC conference
 in Goteborg by Syd Bauman.




 
 Stand\-Off Markup Workgroup
 
 Chaired by David Durand, charged May 2002
 The Workgroup on Stand\-Off markup and Linking has been working on several
 working\-group documents, discussing linking strategy, linguistic annotations, the
 TEI
 canonical reference system, and a summary of the rationale for the larger decisions
 taken in this process. Progress has been slow, but is ongoing. Some portions of the
 work have been presented to the council for feedback, while others are still in
 preparation. Any feedback on the work so far is welcomed. 


Another activity of the group has been the development of some sample software tools
 that may prove helpful to projects engaging with the changes in pointing mechanisms.
 This effort has produced two sample implementations: a Perl script that can translate
 old\-format TEI Extended Pointers in TEI documents into the W3C XPointer syntax,
 recommended by the workgroup, and an implementation of the W3C XPointer language.
 


Working documents updated since last year include: 
 
 * [TEI SOW09](https://www.tei-c.org/Vault/Workgroups/SO/sow09.html)
 Basic working decisions on pointing and linking. Discusses and presents some of
 the major changes proposed by this workgroup.
* SOW3 (last updated Oct. 2004\) is a preliminary revision of chapter 14 of
 the Guidelines, "Linking, Segmentation and Alignment"
 
 not yet integrated into P5\.
* [TEI SO W 08](https://www.tei-c.org/Vault/Workgroups/SO/sow08.html) on
 
 Canonical References has also been revamped, with more
 updates expected..
* The changes proposed by this workgroup are likely to impact almost every
 other chapter in TEI P5\. Some work has begun on considering the changes that
 will need to be made elsewhere, in particular to the discussion of simple
 pointers and linking in the core chapters.


Progress on this workgroup has been slow, and there remain many things yet to do.
 The
 work is carried on by email list and conference call. Energetic volunteers are
 encouraged to contact the chair if they want to participate. 




 Taskforce on SGML/XML Conversion
 
 Chaired by Christine Ruotolo, charged May 2002
The NEH\-funded TEI Task Force on SGML to XML Migration was convened in May 2002 and
 [charged](/Drafts/edw76.html) with developing
 recommendations for migrating existing TEI resources from SGML to XML. The Task Force
 comprised representatives from projects with significant TEI SGML, along with
 selected technical experts and the TEI editors. It worked for the past 18 months to
 diagnose and document the problems, methods, and tools necessary to migrate legacy
 TEI data to XML.


The members of the Task Force met three times altogether \-\- in October 2002 in
 Chicago (immediately following TEI Annual Members Meeting), in February 2003 at the
 University of Maryland, and in June 2003 at the University of Alicante. Minutes from
 each of the meetings are available from the Task Force [activities page](/activities/workgroups/MI/), as is a
 detailed [workplan](https://www.tei-c.org/Vault/Workgroups/MI/miw05.html)
 written after the first meeting.


The primary deliverables of the Task Force are two reports, [Strategic Considerations in Migration of TEI Documents from SGML
 to XML](https://www.tei-c.org/Vault/Workgroups/MI/miw02.html) and the [Practical Guide to Migration of TEI Documents from SGML to XML](https://www.tei-c.org/Vault/Workgroups/MI/miw03.html). The first report, intended for
 administrators and project managers, emphasizes the planning and decision\-making
 involved in data migration, while the second report describes the mechanics of
 conversion in greater detail and is written primarily for the technical staff who
 will implement the conversion. The specific recommendations in the technical report
 are augmented by a set of [Migration Case Study Reports](https://www.tei-c.org/Vault/Workgroups/MI/miw06.html) that discuss individual migration efforts
 undertaken by members of the Task Force.


All documents produced by the Task force \-\- final reports, along with meeting minutes
 and other working papers, are available from the TEI web site in the section given
 above. The information presented there is current as of June 2004; however the Task
 Force has fulfilled its charter and does not expect to update these materials after
 01 July 2004\.




 Manuscript Description Task\-force
 
 Chaired by Matthew Driscoll, charged February 2003
 The Manuscript Description Task\-force was charged to reconcile or merge the various
 schemes for encoding manuscript descriptions using TEI\-conformant XML (principally
 MASTER and the TEI\-MMSS workgroup, but also the scheme devised for the Repertorium
 of
 Old Bulgarian Literature). This task has been fulfilled as of October 2004 and a preliminary
 draft of the
 chapter for P5 was produced by the task force and is now made available for
 public comment. 


The council recognized that this work is a first step towards a better encoding for
 manuscript description within the TEI framework, and that much works remains to be
 done in formalizing several aspects of the descriptions which are currently given
 as
 running text only.




 Metalanguage Workgroup
 
 Chaired by Sebastian Rahtz, charged March 2003
This report should be read in conjunction with other [regular reports](https://www.tei-c.org/Vault/Workgroups/META/) from the work group. 


The workgroup held a face to face meeting in Paris in March 2004, at which the broad
 structure of the new ODD language for representing the innards of the TEI Guidelines
 was hammered out, after many revisions during 2003\. Some of the details have been
 further polished over the following months. One of the remaining questions is whether
 the benefit of the abstraction from the underlying RelaxNG schema language given
 through the ODD syntax made up for the disadvantage of not being able to use all of
 RelaxNG syntax; however, the Council conference call in September agreed that the
 ODD
 language should be frozen for at least 3 months to allow the editors and others time
 for proper assessment of its usability.


The current draft of TEI P5 is fully conformant with the ODD language.


The ODD processor, Roma, for delivery of customized TEI schemas in RelaxNG, DTD and
 W3C Schema syntax, has been completely rewritten and is now available as an [experimental service](../.././tools/Roma/) from the TEI website, and is also
 available as a package for Debian GNU/Linux systems and on a TEI customization of
 the
 Knoppix CD. 




 ISO/TEI Workgroup on Feature Structures
 
 TEI Liaison: Laurent Romary, charged March 2003
This is a joint activity of the TEI together with the ISO TC37/SC4 workgroup on
 Feature Structures. The aim is to revise the chapters on Feature Structure
 Representation (chapter 16\) and Feature Structure Declaration Representation (chapter
 26\) and align them with the current work going on in the ISO WG.


The workgroup met in Nancy Nov. 2003, in Jeju\-do, Korea in Feb. 2004 and in Paris
 August 2004\. The [current draft of chapter 16 for P5](https://www.tei-c.org/Vault/Workgroups/FS/FASC-fs.pdf) is available now. This chapter will form part of
 [ISO DIS 24610](https://www.tei-c.org/Vault/Workgroups/FS/iso-n033-11.pdf).




 Workgroup on Physical Bibliography
 
 Chaired by Terry Catapano, charged May 2004
This is the only new work group charged this past year. It has been charged to
 develop guidelines for encoding information about the physical structure of printed
 books: specifically, information about how individual pages are located and
 identified within the larger structures of signatures and gatherings. The audience
 being served is fairly narrowly construed as the community of descriptive and
 analytical bibliographers for whom this information is essential as a way of
 documenting the construction of the physical book and as the basis for further
 analysis of printing practices and the history of particular editions. 


 While this work group is not expected to cover issues specific to manuscripts, its
 recommendations should not unnecessarily preclude their use to encode similar
 information about manuscript documents, and to this end this work group is expected
 to maintain communication with the Manuscript Description Taskforce and to review
 the
 materials they have already produced in this area. 


Charge, work plan and draft documents for this work group are available at [http://www.tei\-c.org/cms/Activities/Workgroups/PB/](http://www.tei-c.org/cms/Activities/Workgroups/PB/). 




 Other activities of the Council
 
 
 The council was approached by John Smith, Cambridge this spring with the proposal
 to
 develop markup constructs to represent word boundaries in Sanskrit compound work.
 The
 council charged him with this task subsequently and requested that the
 recommendations were developed in a way that could also be applied to similar
 problems in other languages. Different proposals have been discussed within the
 workgroup so far (the latest one is available at [http://www.tei\-c.org/cms/Activities/Workgroups/CE/sanskrit\_proposal\_2\.pdf](http://www.tei-c.org/cms/Activities/Workgroups/CE/sanskrit_proposal_2.pdf), but no
 final recommendations have been submitted yet.)



 Individual Members of the Council reported the following about their
 TEI\-related activities this past year
 
 
 
 Syd Bauman
 
 As one of the only three people who is paid to do TEI\-C work, I am acutely
 aware that part of my job is devoted to those tasks that it is hard or
 impossible to get volunteers to do — the scut work, as it were. But it is
 certainly not the case that all is boring or meaningless; quite the opposite.
 Some of my activities are listed below.


* At Council's request, worked with the FSF to develop a mechanism to apply
 the GFDL to the Guidelines
* Assisted the Chair and Executive Director with the creation of our
 operating procedures
* Detailed editing and revisions of the Migration Task Force's deliverables
 (TEI MI W 02, 03, and 06\)
* Developed the version numbering system for P5 and future releases of the
 Guidelines (TEI ED W 80\)
* Provided feedback on drafts of several chapters of P5 (including MS, TD,
 CH \& WD, CR)
* Revamped the structure of ED W 77 (P4 errors reported \& fixes
 made), and wrote a CSS stylesheet to make it easy to read on the web.
* Applied approximately 30 changes to P4, ranging from fixing minor
 typographical errors, to significant non\-corrigible changes.
* Published a new (error\-fix) release of P4, both HTML and DTDs.
* Progressed the process of removing textual attributes from P5 (the
 so\-called 
 war on attributes, ED W 79\)
* Assisted with the creation of the new work\-group on physical
 bibliography.
* Created and actively participated in the 
 choice group
* At Council's request, with David Durand developed positions on how
 linking will work in P5, and began transition to XPointer
* Assisted CE in coming to decisions on how language identification will
 work in P5
* Initiated the discussions and work (now taken over by Sebastian Rahtz) on
 creating Debian packages for TEI


I have also been active in teaching, promulgating, and promoting TEI, including
 the following 


* Participated in a three\-day TEI training workshop at Wheaton College
 (Norton MA, USA)
* Co\-wrote and co\-presented a paper on the TEI ODD system at the Extreme
 Markup Languages conference (Montreal QC, Canada)
* Wrote and presented a paper on the TEI's proposed use of
 
 xml:lang at ALLC/ACH (Göteborg, Sweden)
* Continued to address user questions, both on and off TEI\-L




 Alejandro Bia
 
 In the last few years, I've been involved in several efforts of mutual
 cooperation with Hispanic scholarly groups, and the organization of courses,
 seminars, and other training and support activities in Spanish language. 


 I've been struggling to spread of the TEI markup scheme in Spanish speaking
 countries: 


* presented courses on XML\-TEI markup in Italy, Spain and México:, CLIP
 2003, JBIDI 2004, 8 SII (Simposium Internacional de Informática). In the
 future there are several similar courses already scheduled.
* been cooperating with the TEI Internationalization project by
 translating the whole TEI tagset and part of the documentation
 descriptions to Spanish. The goal is to have this new Spanish tagset and
 documentation completed and integrated into P5\.
* cooperated with the TEI SGML\-to\-XML Migration Group.
* participated in several research and development projects involving
 TEI markup like teiPublisher, automation of the Newsletters System of the
 MCDL, and others.




 Lou Burnard
 
 As a TEI editor the bulk of my time is supposed to be devoted to editing other
 people's drafts for P5\. In practice, I seem to have devoted more time to
 requesting, wheedling, demanding, or provoking drafts and constructive
 suggestions for revision (or facilitating production of same) than anything
 else much.


This year in particular I have: 


* provided drafting assistance for chapters MS, TD, and FS of P5, as
 well as parts of CO.
* proposed and implemented a way of prioritizing feature requests on
 Source Forge; also provided feedback on all current such requests
* tested and provided design input to the redesign of the ODD system and
 associated software developments


In addition, I have been active in promoting the TEI in various forums,
 notably: 


* Invited presentation at a seminar on [Online
 Access to Qualitative Data](http://www.esds.ac.uk/news/eventdetail.asp?ID=1031) held at the Royal Statistical
 Society, London
* Presentation on TEI Feature Structures at [LREC 2004](https://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0405&L=tei-l&P=R5460)
* Invited plenary on digital editing at a [Workshop on
 editing in the Digital medium](http://www.zrc-sazu.si/slolit/posvetov.htm) at the Institute of Slovenian
 Literature, Ljubljana
* Taught a three day [TEI Workshop](https://www.tei-c.org/Vault/Talks/Forli/2004/) at SSLIMIT, Forli
* Jointly wrote a [paper on
 new ODD system](/cms/Talks/extreme2004/paper.html) and presented it at Extreme Markup Languages
 conference, Montreal
* Organized and taught two day [TEI Workshop](https://www.tei-c.org/Vault/Talks/2004/Wuerzburg/programme.html) in
 Würzburg


Under AOB, I edited a CD called BNC Baby containing three English language
 corpora in TEI XML together with a preliminary version of the [Xaira](http://www.xaira.org) software which goes on sale in
 October. I also spent a substantial amount of time preparing a volume of essays
 on textual editing for publication by the MLA.




 M. J. Driscoll
 
 In addition to chairing the Manuscript Description taskforce mentioned above,
 and ensuring that its outputs were made available in time for this meeting,
 Matthew has been responsible for a number of TEI\-related training and outreach
 exercises this year. 


* I held a two\-day TEI workshop at Johns HopkinsUniversity, 26 and 27
 April 2004\.
* I delivered a 90\-minute plenary lecture on the TEI at The Third
 International Conference on New Technologies and Standards: Digitization
 of National Heritage, Belgrade, 3\-5 June 2004\. This lecture will be
 published in the next volume of the 
 Review of the National Center
 for Digitization.
* Anne Mette Hansen and I held a one\-day workshop on text encoding here
 at the institute on 27 March, where we introduced our colleagues (not for
 the first time) to the wonders of the TEI. Some of them actually now use
 it.
* I organised (along with colleagues from Stofnun Árna Magnússonar in
 Reykjavík, Nordische Abteilung of Universität Tübingen and Abteilung für
 Nordische Philologie, Universität Zürich) a week\-long summer school in
 manuscript studies, 6th\-10th September 2004, one aspect of which was
 electronic text encoding. We had 26 attendees from all over Europe,
 principally Germany, Switzerland and the UK. It was a tremendous
 success.




 Sebastian Rahtz
 
 I have worked for the TEI in 9 areas over the last year: 


I led the Meta workgroup in a deep revision of the ODD language
 in which the Guidelines are written. I have also been responsible for all
 the implementation of the processing of the Guidelines to generate
 schemas and documentation. 
 I wrote a replacement (named Roma) for the TEI Pizza Chef, which
 generates customized schemas for P5\. This was then rewritten from
 scratch, under my supervision, by Arno Mittelbach and delivered for
 testing. It has been kept up to date with changes to the ODD language. 
  I reimplemented the work of Alejandro Bia on
 internationalization of the TEI element, class and attribute names, and
 worked with Alejandro on subsequent revisions. This system is supported
 by Roma. 
 I packaged some key TEI deliverables (TEI\-Emacs, schemas, dtds,
 document, stylesheets, Roma) as Debian packages, according to the Debian
 XML guidelines, and produced an experimental CD for distribution to
 members
 I developed a system using an eXist database to deliver the P5
 sources via a query system, delivered on the same CD. 
 I taught courses in Oxford on the TEI, and talked about the TEI
 at several international conferences 
 I did the initial setup of the Sourceforge project for the TEI
 and have gradually transferred most of my work to it (Roma, stylesheets,
 internationalization, tei\-emacs) 
 I assisted the TEI European editor on day to day work of the TEI
 web site and Guidelines maintenance. 
 I assisted Julia Flanders and Geoffrey Rockwell in the creation
 of a proposed new logo for the TEI 











 Laurent Romary
 
 Revision of the Print Dictionary chapter* In the summer 2004, the Print Dictionary chapter has been fully revised
 to check its consistancy with the new ODD specification platform. This work
 conducted by LR in conjunction with LB and SR was also an opportunity to
 experiment with extension mechanisms in ODD. A call for contributions has
 been made on the TEI list to gather up dictionary samples and observe
 current practices in this domain. From the dozen answers received, some
 proposals have made to improve the expressive power of the PD chapter in the
 domains of historical notes and morphology.
Redrafting of the terminology chapter* A series of discussion have taken place within the TEI list and offline
 as to the best strategy to adopt with regards the outdated P4 chapter on
 terminology. It is proposed that this chapter be fully rewritten to become
 conformant to the TBX syntax as recommended by the Localization Industry
 Standard Association (www.lisa.org), which in turn is conformant with the
 ISO 166642 standard (Terminological Markup Framework). The future chapter
 would limit its scope to a set of core descriptors and would explemplify
 extension mexhanisms for whoever would want an enlarged model.




 Natasha Smith
 
 I was part of the of the [SGML
 to XML conversion task force](/cms/Activities/Workgroups/MI/)  I also give presentations on TEI and
 TEI\-related projects, etc at the UNC School of Infomation and Library Science
 every semester in different classes.




 Edward Vanhoutte
 
 As a new member to the Council, I mainly listened in on the activities,
 debates, and plans, ready to take action in my second year of service. However,
 I worked for the TEI in the following areas over the last year: 


I organized the [TEI Council meeting](/Activities/Council/Meetings/tcm11.xml) of May 13\-15, 2004 at the Royal Academy of Dutch Language
 and Literature in Ghent (Belgium)
 I taught courses on the TEI in Antwerp, Ghent, and London 
 I wrote ["An Introduction to the TEI and the TEI Consortium"](http://www3.oup.co.uk/litlin/hdb/Volume_19/Issue_01/pdf/190009.pdf) in
 
 Literary and Linguistic Computing, 19/1 (April 2004\):
 9\-16\.





 Christian Wittern
 
 I have worked for the TEI as chair of the TEI council and as chair of the
 Character Encoding working group this past year. In addition to that, I have
 given tutorials and introductions to TEI and markup in general, as well
 guidance to TEI projects in Taiwan and Japan.
