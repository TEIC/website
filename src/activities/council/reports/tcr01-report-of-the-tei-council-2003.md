# TCR01: Report of the TEI Council 2003



Report of the TEI Council to the Members Meeting 2003
 
 \[This report summarizes activities of TEI\-funded workgroups
 and TEI\-chartered Task forces reporting to the TEI Technical
 Council during the year ending December 2003\. There will be an
 informal panel session at the TEI Members Meeting during which
 Chairs of workgroups and task forces will be pleased to
 discuss the activities reported on here with members.]


Character Encoding Workgroup
 Chaired by Christian Wittern, charged July 2001This workgroup was charged by the TEI
 Council to
 revise those areas of the TEI Guidelines that deal with representation
 of characters, languages and writing systems, which includes the current
 Chapter 4 (Languages and Character Sets) and Chapter 25 (Writing
 System Declaration).
 
 Since its inception in the Summer of 2001, the Character
 Encoding Workgroup has met twice face to face, in October 2001 in
 Berkeley and in July 2002 in Tübingen. Over this past year, the
 business has been conducted by email, but another face to face meeting
 is planned immediately prior to the Members Meeting in Nancy, November
 2003\. All draft documents of the workgroup are available from the
 workgroup area on the TEI homepage ().
 
 The workgroup has spent most of its effort this past year
 in drafting and revising an introduction to character set issues,
 Unicode and its implication for XML processing. This is available as
 document CEW01 at the website and was presented to the TEI Council in
 May. At that
 time the Council requested some minor changes, which are
 currently being worked on.
 
 Another area of work has been to develop markup
 constructs to augment, modify or replace the orthodox Unicode
 interpretation of characters in specific contexts, as well as to
 provide for the extension of the character set available to text
 encoders. This work is reported in working paper CEW06
 
 which was also discussed by the TEI
 Council. Its underlying model was found to be sound, but considerable
 revision is required, especially to bring it in line with the recent
 developments towards P5\.
 
 The workgroup also tried to collect some use cases of
 these mechanisms in different languages and encoding scenarios and
 some members worked on testing the markup constructs in real life
 projects. The current draft was also presented and discussed with
 fruitful results at a Conference on Character Encoding issues at
 Academia Sinica, Taipei in March 2003\.
 
 The workgroup plans to wrap up the open issues and submit
 a final report to the TEI Council at the next council meeting.
 
 
Stand\-Off Markup Workgroup
 Chaired by David Durand, charged May 2002The Workgroup on Stand\-Off markup and Linking
 has been working on
 several working\-group documents, discussing linking strategy,
 linguistic annotations, the TEI canonical reference system, and a
 summary of the rationale for the larger decisions taken in this
 process. Progress has been slow, but is ongoing. Some portions of the
 work have been presented to the council for feedback, while others
 are still in preparation. We project that the working papers will be
 submitted to the TEI council at the next council meeting, for
 approval. Any feedback on the work so far is welcomed.
 
 Another activity of the group has been the development of
 some sample software tools that may prove helpful to
 projects engaging with the changes in pointing
 mechanisms. This effort has produced two sample
 implementations: A Perl script that can translate old\-format
 TEI Extended Pointers in TEI documents into the W3C XPointer
 syntax, recommended by the workgroup, and an implementation
 of the W3C XPointer language.
 
 Working documents updated since last year include:
 
 * TEI SOW2 technical rationale: An explanation of the rationale for the
 major changes introduced by this workgroup.
* TEI SOW4 Notes on Media formats and XPointer: This document discusses
 the linking of images and image metadata to TEI documents. The
 biggest change here is the use of the SVG (Structured Vector
 Graphics) DTD to tag included images.
* TEI SOW5 Corpus applications: This document describes Corpus and
 other linguistic applications of Standoff markup and annotation
* TEI SOW6 Standoff Markup: discusses the use of the W3C XInclude
 standard to represent standoff markup documents. Revisions are under
 discussion on the group mailing list.
* TEI SOW7: Notes on the representation of graph structures in the TEI;
 generated as advice to any other workgroup that may deal with these
 phenomena. Accepted by Council/finished.
* TEI SOW8: The document is a replacement for the current "canonical
 reference" scheme in the TEI, and has been accepted by the TEI
 Council.
* SOW2, 4, and 5 have received most recent attention.
* SOW3 (revised chapters) is delayed, awaiting the completion of the
 other documents.


 Progress on this workgroup has been slow, and there remain many
 things yet to do. The work is carried on by email list and conference
 call. Energetic volunteers are encouraged to contact the chair if
 they want to participate.
 
 
SGML/XML Conversion Workgroup
 Chaired by Christine Ruotolo, charged May 2002The TEI Task Force on SGML to XML Migration
 was convened in May
 2002 and [charged](/Vault/Workgroups/MI/edw76.html) with
 developing recommendations for migrating existing TEI resources from
 SGML to XML. The Task Force comprises representatives from projects
 with significant TEI SGML investment, along with selected technical
 experts and the TEI editors, and has worked for the past 18 months to
 diagnose and document the problems, methods, and tools necessary to
 migrate legacy TEI data to XML.
 
 The members of the Task Force met three times over the past year: in
 October 2002 in Chicago (immediately following TEI Annual Members
 Meeting), in February 2003 at the University of Maryland, and in June 2003
 at the University of Alicante. Minutes from each of the meetings are
 available from the Task Force [activities page](/activities/MI/), as is a
 detailed [workplan](/Vault/Workgroups/MI/miw05.html)
 written after the first meeting.
 
 The primary deliverables of the Task Force are two reports, [Strategic
 Considerations in Migration of TEI Documents from SGML to XML](/Vault/Workgroups/MI/miw02.html) and
 the [Practical
 Guide to Migration of TEI Documents from SGML to XML](/Vault/Workgroups/MI/miw03.html). The first
 report, intended for administrators and project managers, emphasizes the
 planning and decision\-making involved in data migration, while the second
 report describes the mechanics of conversion in greater detail and is
 written primarily for the technical staff who will implement the
 conversion. The specific recommendations in the technical report are
 augmented by a set of [Migration Case Study Reports](/Vault/Workgroups/MI/miw06.html) (MIW06a\-j) that discuss
 individual migration efforts undertaken by members of the Task Force.
 
 As of October 2003, the reports and case studies have been thoroughly
 reviewed by the Task Force members and edited by a technical writer. The
 final drafts will be circulated back to the group for a brief review
 period before being forwarded on to the TEI Council for comment. The
 reports and case studies will be officially presented to the greater TEI
 community at the Annual Members Meeting in Nancy (November 2003\).
 
 
Manuscript Description Task\-force
 Chaired by Matthew Driscoll, charged February 2003The work of the Manuscript Description
 Task\-force, which has as its
 goal the reconciliation or merging of the various schemes for encoding
 manuscript descriptions using TEI\-conformant XML (principally MASTER
 and the TEI\-MMSS workgroup, but also the scheme devised for the Sofia
 based Repertorium of Old Bulgarian Literature), proceeds apace. The
 members of the task force, Messrs. Bauman, Birnbaum, Burnard, Driscoll
 (chair) and Ms. Proffitt, met in Reykjavík, Iceland, from Sunday 7 to
 Tuesday 9 September 2003\. Minutes of the meeting may be viewed at
 
 In particular we were keen to provide a mechanism for those wishing to encode legacy
 data in as simple a way as possible, i.e. without requiring extensive re\-writing or
 re\-ordering of the data by the encoder (what could be called the TEI\-MMSS approach),
 while at the same time allowing those wishing to produce highly\-structured detailed
 descriptions, possibly but not necessarily on the basis of existing data (the MASTER
 approach) to do so. An idea put forward at the TEI council meeting in Oxford, viz.
 that this might best be accomplished by defining separate elements, one for structured
 and the other for unstructured descriptions, on the analogy of the existing biblStruct
 and bibl, was rejected, as the difference between two approaches are more a matter
 of degree than nature, and a transition from one view to the other should be possible
 without requiring re\-encoding. It was also recognised that the recommendations of
 the two groups (MASTER and TEI\-MMSS) had more in common than not, but that some of
 the ideas underlying them both (and to an extent also the Repertorium scheme) were
 in need of revision. It was decided therefore to take as little as possible for granted,
 but rather to review the entire system, element for element. The result of this review
 is a greatly improved tagset, much more balanced and robust than either of its predecessors.
 Work will be concentrated now on the production of a reference manual and a tutorial
 guide.
 
 
Metalanguage Workgroup
 Chaired by Sebastian Rahtz, charged March 2003This report should be read in conjunction
 with the other
 reports at .
 
 The full task force has not yet met face to face, operating only by
 email, but there have been two fruitful full\-day meetings in October 2003 between
 Lou Burnard,
 Sebastian Rahtz, and Norm Walsh, and Lou Burnard,
 Sebastian Rahtz, and Laurent Romary. These resulted in documents
 [MEW 02](https://www.tei-c.org/Vault/Workgroups/META/mew02.html),
 [MEW 03](https://www.tei-c.org/Vault/Workgroups/META/mew03.html),
 [MEW 04](https://www.tei-c.org/Vault/Workgroups/META/mew04.html) and
 [MEW 05](https://www.tei-c.org/Vault/Workgroups/META/mew05.html). Attention is drawn to the
 analysis in [MEW 02](https://www.tei-c.org/Vault/Workgroups/META/mew02.html) of the relationship
 between TEI and Docbook element classes, as this may prove a fertile
 area of future collaboration. The discussion recorded
 [MEW 05](https://www.tei-c.org/Vault/Workgroups/META/mew02.html) about linking TEI names to
 corresponding concepts in a proposed ISO data category repository is also a very important
 development for
 the future.
 
 The timetable of work under the META umbrella is expected to be
 as follows:
 
 * November 2003: release stable alpha version of P5 schemas
 and Guidelines (in HTML) for comment by members
* November 2003: first draft of new TEI module for tag
 documentation
* December 2003: freeze new ODD format, and hand over
 P5 sources in this form to TEI editors
* January 2004: alpha release of Pizza Chef replacement for ad hoc
 generation of schemas
* February 2004: first release of P5 with new/revised modules for
 manuscript descriptions, feature structures, characters, and linking.


 The remaining sections in this report describe the
 progress on the task force's jobs of:
 
 * Revision of the ODD format to be entirely
 independent of the SGML/XML notation for DTDs
* Combination of the ODD format and the current TEI DTD for tag documentation
 (TSD) into a single standard TEI tagset.
* Basing the new notation on one of the XML schema languages.
* Creation of additional processors to make not
 only XML DTDs (and possibly SGML as well), but also at least
 one XML schema format.
* Conversion of data types should be converted to use the
 datatype library of the W3C.
* Rewriting the Pizza Chef to allow user choice
 of DTD or schema output.


 The final result will be a new version of the TEI Guidelines.
 
 Revision of ODD formatThe markup used to create the TEI Guidelines, from which both
 documentation and DTDs/Schemas are derived, has been reviewed
 several times, and three important sets of changes have been made:
 
 * Elements which have content of literal SGML/XML code have been
 converted either to have neutral TEI markup
* Element names have been changed to make them more independent of
 SGML DTD naming, and to make them more consistent with the rest of the
 TEI. The main reference documentation for element classes, elements,
 and patterns (entities) has been simplified
* Element content models have been converted to use Relax NG
 syntax


 This process should now be complete. The next stage will be to release
 sample subsets of the TEI source for comment by other working groups
 (eg manuscripts, feature structures, and standoff markup), to check
 that they are useable for future editing.
 
 
New module for tag documentationThe revision of the TSD tagset, to turn it into a
 proper
 TEI module and to make it conform to the current Guidelines source,
 has not yet been started. It is planned to complete this during
 November 2003\.
 
 
Schema languageThe Guidelines have been converted to express element syntactic
 constraints using Relax NG. This work is complete, and awaiting
 more user testing. The Relax NG compact syntax is used for display in
 the HTML version of the Guidelines.
 
 
Processors to generate schemasTools to generate RelaxNG schemas and DTDs from the
 new Guidelines
 have been completed, written as XSLT transforms. The results await
 user testing.
 
 A tool to generated W3C Schemas from the Guidelines has not been
 written. It is intended to produce them using James Clark's
 trang program from the RelaxNG schemas, on demand.
 
 
DatatypesAs described in the [May report](https://www.tei-c.org/Vault/Workgroups/META/mew01.html),
 23 datatypes (linked to W3C datatypes where relevant) have been
 defined, and linked to all the simple attribute cases. Work has not
 yet started on looking at element content models to see where they
 would benefit from datatyping.
 
 
Pizza chef rewriteA prototype processor to replace the pizza chef, called
 roma was developed to demonstrate at XML Europe 2003;
 it works by offering a fixed set of choices (including exotica like
 using MathML as the content for formula), but has not yet
 been revised to work with the latest revision of P5\. Work will start
 on this in January 2004\.
 
 

Joint ISO/TEI Activity on Feature Structures
 Chaired by Kyong Lee: chartered January 2003TEI and ISO TC37/SC4 are jointly sponsoring
 an activity which will
 result in adoption of a version of the TEI proposals for encoding
 linguistic annotations using the feature structure formalism. The
 group was chartered by the TEI Council in January 2003 () and is chaired by Kyong
 Lee, with TEI input coming
 from Laurent Romary. A draft for the standard was circulated in the
 summer, and there are a number of comments which will be integrated
 and discussed at a face to face meeting to be held in Nancy immediately
 before the Members Meeting. A further meeting is planned for next
 spring.

 Training activities directed by the TEI Council
 
 TEI Training
 Session at MM02: Encoding Literary and Cultural Documents in TEIThe TEI annual members'
 meeting in 2002, held in Chicago, Illinois,
 was accompanied by a one\-day training workshop entitled "TEI Training
 Session: Encoding Literary and Cultural Documents in TEI".
 
 This training session used a case study model to provide advice and
 discussion on specific topics in text encoding, based on real\-world
 problems supplied by the participants. The session was aimed at those
 responsible for designing their project's encoding system. It
 provided an opportunity to take a focused look at a particular
 problem or set of problems, in a group of knowledgeable peers guided
 by TEI experts. Participants were expected to have some basic
 familiarity with the TEI. The session focused on the encoding of
 literary and cultural documents, interpreted broadly.
 
 The session was held from 1 to 6 pm on Thursday, October 10\. Each
 participant was asked to bring a problem or encoding challenge from
 their own project. The session began with a general discussion of the
 topics raised, followed by focused attention to each particular case
 in turn. The instructors addressed each participant's questions in
 depth and also drew comparisons among the projects represented. The
 goal of the session was not only to answer the participants' specific
 questions, but also to place them in the context of issues such as
 retrieval, data interchange, and long\-term project goals.
 
 There were 16 participants in the workshop, and three instructors
 (Julia Flanders, Syd Bauman, and Terry Catapano).
 
 The feedback was positive (I am ashamed to say that I can't find the
 actual responses, so I can't give quotes); people liked the
 discussion format and the opportunity to address specific encoding
 questions from their own projects, and they found the perspective on
 other projects helpful as well. We allowed a few beginners to attend
 at their request, and they found the session moved too quickly and
 didn't provide enough background (which was to be expected, but
 suggests that either clarifying this point or making sure to offer
 introductory training as well would be desirable when possible).
 
 

 
 TEI Training at ACH/ALLC 2003
 
 Amit Kumar and Susan Schreibman of Maryland Institute for Technology in the
 Humanities (MITH) offered two one\-day TEI training workshops in conjunction
 with the 2003 ACH/ALLC Annual Conference in Athens Georgia on 28\-29 May.
 
 On 28 May an Introduction to TEI and XML workshop was taken by eight
 students. The workshop consisted of lectures and exercises that introduced
 students to basic XML and TEI concepts, the TEILite DTD, constructing a TEI
 Header, and how to use CSS with TEI. Comments were positive: "Thanks for an
 excellent workshop \& plain, down\-to\-earth explanations/comments"; "this was
 \[an] excellent workshop. I really appreciate about everything (except that
 the length was too short)".
 
 On 29 May, and Introduction to XSLT workshop was taken by fourteen students.
 Again, the format was lectures punctuated by exercises. All the exercises
 transformed documents encoded in TEI. Students were introduced to XSLT and
 XPath expressions, XSL templates, node trees, and element/attribute
 matching, as well as XSLT processing models. Students were generally
 satisfied with the workshop and comments were positive: "Nice format,
 excellent instructors, very personable, friendly, receptive"; "there were
 some typos \& the like in some of the handouts, but all the same, one could
 generally find them \& work them through. Well\-selected \& organized
 materials \- an excellent preparation job!"
 
 
Report on Rhodes University WorkshopFrom 8th to 12th September 2003, sixteen delegates
 from all over
 South Africa took part in the five\-day workshop ‘Book \& Text
 Studies: Humanities Computing’ at Rhodes University (Grahamstown,
 South Africa). The workshop was funded by the Association for
 Literary and Linguistic Computing (ALLC), certified by the TEI,
 and sponsored by The Department of Computer Science and the
 Department of English at Rhodes University (SA), The
 School of Library, Archive, and Information Studies at University
 College London (UK), and The Centre for Scholarly Editing
 and Document Studies of the Royal Academy of Dutch Language and
 Literature (Belgium). The latter two institutions allowed
 gratis the services of the lecturers Melissa Terras and
 Edward Vanhoutte \& Ron Van den Branden, respectively.
 
 The five\-day workshop provided introductory training in the theory and
 practice of digitizing text and images for those working in book and
 text studies. Training in these skills for those working in the
 Humanities is not readily available in South Africa, but both
 academics and advanced students are increasingly aware of the need to
 bring their work into line with that of colleagues elsewhere
 implementing more advanced technologies. Course participants came from
 institutions as diverse as the National English Literary Museum,
 Rhodes University, The University of Zululand, The University of
 Witwatersrand, The National Archives of South Africa, etc. showing
 the interest in learning the appropriate standards and technologies
 relevant to their collections.
 
 The five workshop days each consisted of two morning sessions
 (8:30\-10:00 \& 10:30\-12:00\) and two afternoon sessions (1:30\-3:00
 \& 3:30\-5:00\) of 90 minutes each. After the first session which
 introduced the workshop, Humanities Computing as a discipline, the
 associations, journals, mailing\-lists, publications, and institutions
 involved, Edward Vanhoutte taught five (hands\-on) sessions on XML and
 TEI, followed by four (hands\-on) sessions on XSL taught by Ron Van den
 Branden, and four (hands\-on) sessions on digitizing images and textual
 resources taught by Melissa Terras. The workshop concluded with two
 sessions on project management taught by Melissa Terras and Edward
 Vanhoutte. On the evening of the first day, the Terry Sander’s
 documentary film Into the Future, On the Preservation of
 Knowledge in the Electronic Age was shown. The course
 culminated with a course dinner, which cemented friendships made on
 the course: an additional positive outcome of such a workshop being
 the contacts made between the various institutions and interested
 parties taking part, who were unaware of each others existence prior
 to the workshop.
 
 All participants were provided with printouts of the lectures and a
 copy of the CD\-ROM XML, XSL \& Digitisation. Tools and
 Resources, compiled by the instructors for this workshop and
 sponsored by the Centre for Scholarly Editing and Document
 Studies.
 
 Judging from the constant interaction with the participants during
 the workshop, their comments afterwards, and the many letters of
 thanks and support the local organiser, Professor John Gouws received,
 the instructors feel that this was a very successful workshop which
 filled an urgent need in Africa.

 TEI Training activities at Oxford
 
 Sebastian Rahtz and Lou Burnard again taught their four half\-days course introducing
 the fundamentals of the TEI
 architecture and processing with XSLT at Oxford University in February. Teaching
 materials from this course and a summary are both available [on the TEI
 web site](/Talks/OUCS/2003-02/).
 
 Lou Burnard taught a three day practical workshop on Corpus encoding with the
 TEI at the Scuola Superiore di Lingue per
 Interpreti e Traduttore in Forlí, Italy
 in April. Teaching materials and overview are
 also available [on the TEI
 web site](/Talks/Forli/2003/).
 
 

Reports from individual council members about their TEI related asctivities
 
 Report on TEI\-related activities 2002\-2003: Tomaž ErjavecI have been a TEI Council
 member since November 2001\. In that capacity
 I attended three telephone conferences and one two day meeting in
 Oxford.
 
 In the preparation for release of TEI P4 I have read and commented on
 the P3 chapter on Simple Analytic Mechanisms. I translated into
 Slovene and circulated the Press Release for TEI P4\.
 
 I am a member of the TEI/NEH Workgroup on SGML to XML Migration, where
 I contributed a sample P3 to P4 migration of the multilingual
 annotated MULTEXT\-East corpus. I am also a member of the ISO/TEI
 Workgroup on Feature Structures, where I have so far commented on the
 preliminary draft of ISO TC 37/SC 4 N033 Language Resource Management
 \- Feature Structures. For the Nancy members meeting I have proposed a
 TEI SIG on Language Technologies.
 
 In connection with TEI training, I have given a course on "Annotation
 of Language Resources" at the 14th European Summer School in Logic,
 Language and Information (ESSLLI'02\), Trento, August 5\-9, 2002\.
 
 In my own work, I have in the last two years used TEI to encode
 various resources. Some of these projects are now completed, some are
 on\-going, and most had their results presented at conferences and in
 journal papers: the IJS\-ELAN Slovene\-English linguistically annotated
 parallel corpus; the ontology\-annotated GENIA corpus of MEDLINE
 abstracts; the MULTEXT multilingual morphosyntactic specifications;
 the Slovene Dependency Treebank; a Japanese\-Slovene learners'
 dictionary; and eSlomsek, a text\-critical edition of 19th century
 sermons by St Slomšek.
 
 
David J. BirnbaumFor the TEI, I served
 on the Character Set Work Group, on the Manuscript Description Task Force
 (which Matthew Driscoll chaired), and on the TEI Council.
 
 Over the past year I published "Computer\-Assisted Analysis and Study
 of the Structure of Mixed Content Miscellanies" in "Scripta \& e\-Scripta,"
 vol. 1, 2003, 15\-54\. I also gave invited lectures or conference
