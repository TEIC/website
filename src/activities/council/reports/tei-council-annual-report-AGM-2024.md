# Report of the TEI Council Activities to the Members Meeting, 2024

The TEI Technical Council accomplished much in the past year since our meeting in Paderborn in 2023, perhaps most notably introducing a new chapter on computer-mediated communication to the TEI Guidelines. 

*  Council completed and closed:
     * [132 tickets and pull requests](https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues?page=2&q=closed%3A%3E2023-09-03) on the TEI Guidelines GitHub repo 
     * [79 tickets and pull requests](https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets/issues?page=1&q=closed%3A%3E2023-09-05) on the TEI Stylesheets GitHub repo 
* Council issued two releases of the TEI Guidelines:
     * [Version 4.7.0](https://tei-c.org/Vault/P5/current/doc/tei-p5-doc/readme-4.7.0.html), codenamed “in nova fert animus”, November 16, 2023. This release
          * added a new `<eventName>` element
          *  included `<taxonomy>` and `<category>` in `att.datcat`
     * [Version 4.8.0](https://tei-c.org/Vault/P5/current/doc/tei-p5-doc/readme-4.8.0.html), “the Six Degrees release", July 8, 2024, with special thanks to the [CMC SIG](/Activities/SIG/CMC/). This release adds [a new chapter on Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC)](https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/CMC.html) to the TEI Guidelines with just one new `<post>` element  and two new attribute classes: `att.cmc` and `att.indentation`

Besides monthly council calls, the Technical Council hosted three extensive weekend “Virtual Face 2 Face meetings” (VF2Fs) over 3 weekends (March – May 2024) + the in-person F2F meeting in Buenos Aires in October 2024.

The TEI Stylesheets Co-op group has held monthly meetings to solve processing problems and update the codebase of the [Stylesheets](https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets).

The following Task Forces were active this year connected with Council activities:
* Another TEI ODD Processor (ATOP) task force has been upgrading the processing of customization ODD.
* A new task force is beginning to work on TEI Lite2 customization as precursor to TEI P6.
