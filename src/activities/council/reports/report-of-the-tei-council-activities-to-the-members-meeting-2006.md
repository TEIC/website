# Report of the TEI Council activities to the Members Meeting 2006




Executive summary
 
 
 The TEI Council is in charge of overseeing the technical development of the TEI
 Guidelines. As in the past, during the current year, all energy was devoted to develop
 P5, slated to become the next major revision of the
 Guidelines. As has become the rule for a while now, the
 Council took on more and more tasks by itself and only a
 part of the work has been done by workgroups or task\-forces.
 The Council held a very intense two\-day face\-to\-face meeting
 with all its members in Kyoto, which was held in conjunction
 with a TEI outreach event "TEI Day in Kyoto 2006", to which
 Council members contributed the major portion of papers and
 posters. 



 As usual, the Council also conducted its
 regular business through telephone conferences, a mailing list and through an IRC
 channel.


The highlights of the TEI development work in the period since the previous Members
 meeting can be summarized as follows: 


Personography Activity* A new ad hoc task force was formed under the
 supervision of Matthew
 Driscoll to extend the TEI Guidelines where necessary to
 allow for the description of people and there activities.
TEI Workgroups quick update* The 
 Workgroup on Stand\-Off markup,
 chaired by David Durand and the 
 Joint ISO\-TEI activity on Feature Structures, chaired by Kiyong Lee.completed its
 tasks in early 2006\. The Council expressed its thanks to the chairs and members of
 these workgroups and is now busy integrating the results
 into the Guidelines.
Review of the Guidelines* In continuing the review process started last
 year, the Council now looked at all the chapters and
 elements or attributes defined therein to determine how
 the definition should be changed in light of the new class
 system.


Information about the status of P5, how to use it and much more is available at the
 [P5 section](../../../Guidelines/P5/) of the TEI website.


There has been a change in membership of the Council in late April, Alejandro Bia
 stepped down because of other pressing duties; his place was taken over by Amit Kumar.
 Many thanks to Alejandro for his efforts at the TEI Council and also to Amit for his
 willingness to stand in in the middle of everything.




 
 Work of the Council
 
 
 This has been a particularily busy year for the council, although the main goal, that
 is delivering P5 version 1\.0 has not been met. We do have reason to hope that with
 the major roadblocks out of the way, it will not take another year to meet that goal.
 


While the big architectural changes did place in the previous year, this year was
 characterized by trying to adjust the many pieces that turned up and needed attention.
 I will enumerate a few, but there have been a lot more, as will be obvious to anybody
 looking at the [minutes of our meetings](../..//activities/Council/Meetings/) or even the [email list archive](http://lists.village.virginia.edu/pipermail/tei-council/). 


John Walsh looked into how the various elements used for bibliographic data (
 bibl, 
 biblFull, 
 biblStruct and 
 biblItem could be streamlined to make the whole easier to understand and use.


Dot Porter and Conal Tuohy spend a lot of time to look at how a TEI text should link
 to a image representation of the text or portions of it, a draft of this document
 (which has bot been finalized) is [available](http://www.rch.uky.edu/image_encoding.html)


There was also an intense discussion about how TEI conformance should be understood
 in light of the new customization mechanism, but no conclusion has been reached yet.


Another working document edited by David Birnbaum for the Council looked at what kind
 of guiding principles should inform the long\-term strategy for further development
 of the TEI Guidelines, weighting the need for adoption to new developments against
 the need for stability. The document is now available as [TCW09: Backward Compatibility and the Maintenance of the Text Encoding Initiative
 Guidelines](../..//activities/Council/tcw09.xml). This is still in draft stage and comments are welcome.




 
 Status of the Workgroups and Activities overseen by the Council
 
 
 
 
 Collaboration of the TEI Council and the W3C ITS working group
 
 
 TEI Liaision: Sebastian Rahtz
Sebastian Rahtz is still actively involved with the W3C workgroup on internationalization
 of
 tag sets, which is chaired by Richard Ishida. The workgroup is using the TEI ODD
 system to develop the specification, with a hand\-crafted ODD processor producing
 documentation in a format suitable to the W3C. More information at [the website of the WG.](http://www.w3.org/International/its/)




 
 Workgroup on Physical Bibliography
 
 
 Chaired by Murray McGillivray, charged May 2004
The workgroup is still actively developing specifications suitable for the physical
 description of bibliographic items. A first working draft has been produced (available
 from [the WG's website](../..//activities/Workgroups/PB/)), but the discussion is continuing and changes to the current draft are likely. 




 
 Personography
 
 
 The personography task force was charged in January 2006\. In the following months,
 some preliminary work has been done, which was followed by a face to face meeting
 in late April. The first report was presented at the "TEI Day in Kyoto" and subsequently
 discussed by the Council. Most of the results have already been incorporated into
 the Guidelines, but there are some open issues, which will require another meeting
 to be scheduled.
