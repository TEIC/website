# TEI Community

If you use the TEI, or are planning to, there are many ways to get involved in TEI's global and multilingual community of users and developers. Everyone is welcome and no previous knowledge of TEI or coding is required. This page lists a few ways to get involved.

## Join a Community Call

The TEI community meets on Zoom every month at two alternating times to cover our global community. See the [TEI Events calendar](https://members.tei-c.org/Events?EventViewMode=1&EventListViewMode=2) to join the next call! 

The calls provide an opportunity for the TEI community to get together, share ideas, discuss proposals, and ask questions to peers. An agenda is usually circulated beforehand (see Communication Channels below).

## Communication Channels

Please note that the [TEI Code of Conduct](http://localhost:8080/about/code-of-conduct/) applies to all communication channels.

## Annual General Meeting and Conference

TEI Members meet annually at an in-person [general meeting](https://members.tei-c.org/Events/meetings), which is typically part of a larger conference event open to members and non-members alike.
