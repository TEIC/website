# Music SIG

This SIG aims to:
* Bring together users of the TEI who are interested in **incorporating encoding for music** into their TEI documents or in **encoding music-related documents**.
* Provide recommendations and examples for encoding music notation within TEI.
* Provide integration of TEI with Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) and possibly other standards (such as MusicXML).
* Provide recommendations on displaying text documents with embedded music notation.
* Discuss the use of TEI for markup of music theoretic terms and references to scores and performances.

This SIG is a small but active group. To follow and participate in our work, please visit:

* The `#sig-music` channel on the [TEI Slack](https://www.tei-c.org/activities/community/). If you're interested in MEI you may also want to join [their Slack](https://music-encoding.org/community/community-contacts.html).
* The [GitHub repository](https://github.com/TEI-Music-SIG) where we keep:
   * [TEI with MEI schemas](https://github.com/TEI-Music-SIG/tei-mei)
   * [Encoding and rendering examples](https://github.com/TEI-Music-SIG/examples)
