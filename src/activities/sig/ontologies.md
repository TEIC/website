# Ontologies SIG

 In May and June 2004, there was a discussion on the TEI mailing list about prosopographical
 tags. This led to a suggestion that detailed information about persons (physical and
 legal), dates, events, places, objects etc. and their interpretation could be marked
 up outside the text, and that this could be connected to on\-going ontology work being
 done e.g. in the Museum community, such as the Conceptual Reference Model ([CIDOC\-CRM](http://cidoc.ics.forth.gr/index.html)). The result of this was the establishment of a Ontologies SIG at the 4th annual
 members meeting of TEI in October 2004\.
