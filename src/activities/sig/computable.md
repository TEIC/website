# Computable Text and Media SIG

This special interest group seeks to create TEI encoding practices for various forms of digitally created content. It should also cover processable text on
physical media. Some examples:

- e-literature
- e-mail correspondence
- social media postings (see also new CMC chapter!)
- floppy disk magazines (my personal interest)
- program code (also in print and manuscript)
- punchcards (as "paperware")
- forms

The Computable Text and Media SIG will likely intersect with other SIGs at some points (e.g. CMC and Correspondence). One of the challenges will be to elaborate
neat and simple extensions and/or practices to generalize or broaden the
scope of TEI to include specific aspects of computable text and media.

For example, at the moment when this SIG is formed (January 2025), some chapters of the TEI cover only physical material (e.g. `<msDesc>`), so there is possible demand for more abstract "superclasses" (similar to `<ab>`, for example) to make them more generally applicable to physical and digital media.


## Convener
The SIG is convened by [Torsten Roeder](https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/zpd/zentrum/team/roeder-torsten/) (Center for Philology and Digitality, University of WÃ¼rzburg).
