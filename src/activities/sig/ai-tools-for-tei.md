# AI Tools for TEI SIG

This SIG is focused on the use of AI tools/LLMs for creating, enhancing, and analyzing TEI text. Many TEI practitioners are experimenting with using these tools to create new workflows for generating TEI text, including OCR, encoding, named entity recognition, and quality assurance. We need a robust forum for sharing this work in progress, to avoid unnecessary and wasteful duplication of effort.  Given the amount of out-of-copyright digitized text available in libraries and repositories like HathiTrust, and the rapid improvement of AI tools for processing text, we have the potential to quickly and dramatically increase the amount of TEI-encoded text that is freely available to the public for literary and semantic analysis, mapping, modeling, the creation of new scholarly editions, and many other purposes.  A coordinated approach is the key to unlocking this potential, and now is the time to get started.
