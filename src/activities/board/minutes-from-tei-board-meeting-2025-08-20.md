     *   Magdalena Turska moves, James Cummings seconds

    * Room assignment and sessions chair selection are underway
    * The poster session will be nearby other sessions, rather that a dedicated room, so that they can stay up for the duration of the conference

    *   We have our winners
    *   Community Prize language and promotion needs to be firmed up
    *  Reluctant to be too prescriptive -- keen not to hamstring future committees
    * It would be great to make a badge that winners could put on their sites. The new logo designer would still be game to work with us

    * We will preserve the Rhatz Prize runner up option

    * Should Slack be mentioned on the main page of the TEI site 
    * All in agreemetn about rebooting an editorial group for the website -- an invitation can go out at the AGM and online.
