     *   Magdalena Turska moves, James Cummings seconds

    *   We have our winners
    *   Community Prize language and promotion needs to be firmed up
    *  Reluctant to be too prescriptive -- keen not to hamstring future committees
    * It would be great to make a badge that winners could put on their sites. The new logo designer would still be game to work with us

    * We will preserve the Rhatz Prize runner up option
